I've booked FW11 for the 10th.  We also have a speaker lined up: Oleg
Kiselyov, who's visiting for a few days, has offered to talk about
generating code with polymorphic let.

Hey Jeremy -- any thoughts of broadcasting this on the web? I'd love to be
involved to some degree. Perhaps you could hook up a webcam on twitch.tv or
youtube and have someone monitoring the chat feed or IRC?

Is anyone interested and able to set this up?  I think a few people
outside the lab would be interested to tune in for Oleg's talk.

I'm happy to give this a shot.  The only hitch is that the wifi in the
Computer Lab is currently very unreliable and can barely get two pings
out without packet loss, so I fear for the fidelity.

I'll give it a try tomorrow and see how it looks on a Google Hangout
(I assume this is the right technology to use?  I've never tried twitch).

I've found a link describing how to use twitch (mostly used by gamers) for
this kind of thing:
https://thelevelupnews.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/teaching-with-twitch-or-how-to-livestream-your-lectures-without-university-support/

but it seems like Google Hangouts On Air (
https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair) is now the right way to go. It'll
even save it to youtube when you're done.

Wifi is bad in the computer lab? How ironic. How about an ethernet
connection then?

We should check with the speaker that this is ok. Most talks at the hacking sessions are informal but recording for posting online is something else.

OK well I think it's just an option to save to youtube -- it's not
something it does automatically.

Of course.  I want to be clear that we don't make decisions without involving the speaker :)

How has this gone in the past?
