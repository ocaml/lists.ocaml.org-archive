Subject: [compiler-hacking] Use of opam-compiler-conf: install packages
Message-ID: <570158D1.90204@ensta.fr>

Hello,

I switched to a modified version of OCaml using Gabriel Scherer's
opam-compiler-conf script. But when I try to install the core package, I
get a version error:

> $ ocaml -version
> The OCaml toplevel, version 4.04.0+dev0-2016-02-18
> $ opam install core
> [ERROR] core is not available because your system doesn't comply with ocaml-version
>         >= "4.02.1" & ocaml-version < "4.03".

Is there any clean way to install packages with a modified version of
the compiler?

Thanks,

Olivier

Is your OPAM package list up-to-date?  Recent versions of Core (e.g.
113.33.00) should meet the version constraints for modified trunk
compilers:

   https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/core/core.113.33.00/opam#L29

Whether they'll actually build is another question, of course.

Kind regards,

Jeremy.

Hi, Olivier

Which version of Core are you trying to install? From opam page[1], I can see Jane Street has relaxed version constraint since 113.24.01.
Another way is to download a copy of the source code locally, modify the constraint in opam file, and use ``opam pin add core .`` to install this local copy.

Thank you, I just needed to do an `opam update`. But now the ppx-tools
and sexplibs packages fail to build, and I'm quite sure it is not due to
my changes in translcore.ml (I merely changed a condition to `true` so
that records are always updated fieldwise). For example, the build of
ppx_tools fails with:

    File "src/gen/common.ml", line 73, characters 24-34:
    Error: This expression has type Types.constructor_arguments
           but an expression was expected of type Types.type_expr list

Am I missing something or did my changes really break the package?

Best regards,

Olivier

It's quite likely that the released versions of ppx-tools and sexplib
don't compile with OCaml trunk.  Packages that depend on compiler-libs
tend to break whenever there's a significant change to a module such
as Parsetree or Types.

Working with version 4.02.3 fixed the problem. Thank you!

BTW, regarding JS packages, the ones currently released in opam are < 4.03
only. We do have a version of core and other Jane Street packages that
works with 4.03. It's being released [1]. I'm not sure it's working with
4.03.0+trunk though, and it's definitely not working with 4.04. We are
thinking of ways to improve compatibility of at least the ppx rewriters
