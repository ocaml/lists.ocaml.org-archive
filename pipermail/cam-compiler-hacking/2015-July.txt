It's about time we had another compiler hacking meet-up!  Aiming for
some time in the week starting 12th July should leave us with enough
time to make arrangements.  Suggestions for a particular day and/or
venue are welcome.

I'm travelling that week unfortunately, but back from the 21st July
onwards.  If that's not too late, I could see if I could find a room
in Pembroke College if we'd like a venue in the middle of town this
time (with reliable wifi!).

Thanks!  A room at Pembroke on the week of the 21st sounds ideal.
