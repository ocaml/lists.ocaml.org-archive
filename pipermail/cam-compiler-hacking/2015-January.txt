It's about time that we got together for another evening of compiler
hacking!  I'd like to propose that we meet a week on Tuesday, i.e.
10th February.

There's the question of venue: we could meet at the lab or somewhere
in town (Makespace or the Postdoc centre) or somewhere else.
Thoughts?

Personally, I'm in favour of a return to the lab. We haven't had a
session there for a while.
