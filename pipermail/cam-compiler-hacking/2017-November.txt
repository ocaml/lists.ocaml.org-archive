Subject: [compiler-hacking] OCaml Hack Evening - 4.06 opam fixes & compiler
 projects - Thurs 7 December 19:00-22:30
Message-ID: <CAL4csrQCynqFdX2tCrTWgq__SFaFDCTEBw8ic9CaFSY57F78Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The recent OCaml 4.06 release has made the long-awaited switch to immutable
strings by default. However, this has resulted in a significant number of
opam packages requiring modifications to build  - we are hosting an OCaml
Hack Evening on *Thursday 7th December* from *19:00-22:30 at Pembroke
College* to fix as many as possible.

Please indicate your interest via the Doodle
<https://doodle.com/poll/9aq9t6uzb4uf5mhp> by Thursday 30th November.

All welcome!

Thanks,

Gemma

*When*: Thursday 7 December 2017, 19:00 - 22:30
*Where*: The Thomas Gray Room, Pembroke College, Cambridge CB2 1RF
*Who*: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming
will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml
internals isn't necessary
*Refreshments*: Finger buffet in hack room
*What*:
?Fixing opam packages, ?
fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals
*Wiki*: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

This hack evening focuses on fixing up opam packages as well as work on the
OCaml compiler.

The OCaml 4.06 release featured safe-string as the default rather than
optional as per previous releases. The focus of this event will be to work
on the opam repository to fix up as many packages as possible, and also to
publish a guide on ocamllabs.io detailing how to migrate your packages for
wider use.

The evening will also feature a short (5-10 min) presentation about recent
MirageOS Marrakech Hack Retreat.

?As well as fixing up opam packages, you can find information on mini
projects
<https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on> and
other compiler projects on the wiki
<https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki>.?
