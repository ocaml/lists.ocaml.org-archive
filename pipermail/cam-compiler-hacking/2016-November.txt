Hi all,

The evenings are getting dark - come and hack with us!

Next Wednesday evening is our Autumn Compiler Hacking event at Pembroke
College. This time we are opening it up to a wider group and we are
inviting the MirageOS team to join us while they are preparing for the new
release.

If you'd like to work on fixing bugs, writing docs, creating tutorials,
sorting through PRs, writing up some short blog posts or just learning more
about OCaml and Mirage, then come and join us.

There are lots of mini projects that you might find interesting:

* Compiler:
https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on
* Mirage Pioneer Projects: http://canopy.mirage.io/Projects

Let us know if there is something you'd like to work on!

We will be in N7 (through the second archway on the left) from 630pm
onwards, please indicate your interest via the Doodle (
http://doodle.com/poll/fsy7gue9xvbvvdm8), and let me know if you will be
eating with us. You can eat in the buttery (between 545pm-645pm) or have
some buffet food in the room itself - let me know your preference so that I
don't over/under order on buffet food.

More details on the blog:
https://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2016/11/01/fifteenth-compiler-hacking-evening.html

All welcome!

Thanks,

Gemma

If you are planning on attending, we'd appreciate the Doodle being filled in this week so that we can sort out catering in good time.

Feel free to fill it in if you're not sure yet of your attendance. Excess food will be given to Jimmy's Night Shelter so it won't go to waste.

Anil

Dear all,

Just a reminder that compiler hacking is on this evening at Pembroke in room N7 from 1830 onwards.  The current attendee list and food choices are here: http://doodle.com/poll/fsy7gue9xvbvvdm8

If you feel you are unable to make it tonight, or wish to attend and haven't yet signed up, then both of these are ok!  We will ensure that uneaten fresh food is donated to a local charity, and provide some additional wine for those who feel the need for some liquid sustenance :)

A few topics to hack on this evening are:

- "Junior jobs" in Mantis for the core OCaml compiler; https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php -- suitable for beginners.

- Using MirageOS 3 from the development tree and reporting bugs https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev. The MirageOS3 release is in full swing, and we would like to port libraries to topkg and get them up on http://docs.mirage.io.

- Configuring the Merlin editor and getting Fred and Gemma more feedback on the roadmap for the next release due in a few months: https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/projects/1

- Trying out the recent release of OCaml 4.04 (e.g. flambda) and the Spacetime debugger

- And anything else that captures your interest. A number of us are newcomers to these evenings, so please do feel free to mingle and ask questions of more regular attendees!

regards,
Anil

Dear all,

Thank you to those who came to the hack event on Wednesday - it was a busy
night of hacking!

I've collected summaries of everyone's activities that night, and posted
them here: http://reynard.io/2016/11/16/CompHack.html - please let me know
if there's anything I've missed or you think needs adding.

The next hack event is currently scheduled for 7th Feb 2017 at Pembroke,
and we'll get a doodle etc up soon for it.

Thanks again,

Gemma
