If anybody else is planning to cycle over from the Lab, shall we meet 
outside the Lab's main entrance at 6pm?

Alternatively, if you get there by camel instead of cycling I guess 
you'll get a special mention on a webpage somewhere. Maybe the Vet 
school across the road has a fleet of camels they can loan out.
