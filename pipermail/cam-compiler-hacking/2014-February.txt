Subject: [compiler-hacking] OCaml compiler hacking session
Message-ID: <CAAxsn=EKie914JSS2MmYmYgcjTfpFRX1n2sfa4f36L-7CLRrvw@mail.gmail.com>

It's time for the fourth Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking session!
We'll be meeting in the Computer Lab again next Tuesday evening.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could
indicate interest via Doodle:

and sign up to the mailing list to receive updates:

    http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking

Where: Room FW11, Computer Laboratory, Madingley Road
       Directions to the building: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/directions/
       Room plan:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/openroommap/static/?s=FW11&labels=1

When: 6pm, Tuesday 18th February

Who: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml
programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working
on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

What: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

Wiki: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's
part of the standard distribution, which means at least the standard
library, runtime, tools (ocamldep, ocamllex, ocamlyacc, etc.),
ocamlbuild, the documentation, and the compiler itself. We'll have
suggestions for mini-projects for various levels of experience, but
feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

We'll also be ordering pizza, so if you want to be counted for food
you should aim to arrive by 6.30pm.
