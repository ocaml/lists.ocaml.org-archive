Hi,

The next OCaml compiler hacking evening will be help at Pembroke
College on Tuesday 31st May. Check the blog for details:
http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2016/05/20/spring-compiler-hacking.html

We've arranged a self-service buttery dinner at 6:30pm - please head
to the buttery when you arrive and help yourself to the food choices
available. You can then bring your dinner to the Old Library (just
next door) to sit down and eat.

Please let us know (via the Doodle
http://doodle.com/poll/qx649tkmmq7kg5u4#table) if you are coming.

All welcome!
