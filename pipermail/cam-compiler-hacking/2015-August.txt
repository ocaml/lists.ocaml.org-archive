Subject: [compiler-hacking] OCaml compiler hacking evening next Friday (28th
	August)
Message-ID: <CAAxsn=ESFMiX6qD=qeTi2+nQxshQ_TMmYrPegPhiFfbX3H5OsA@mail.gmail.com>

We'll be meeting in FW26 in the Computer Lab next Friday (28th August
2015) for another evening of compiler hacking.  All welcome!

We'll also be having an afternoon of OCaml- and ML-related talks
beforehand, with titles suspiciously similar to talks at the ML and
OCaml Workshops the following week.

The website has the schedule and other details:

   http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2015/08/20/mini-workshop.html

If you're planning to come along to either the talks or to compiler
hacking, please add yourself to the poll:
