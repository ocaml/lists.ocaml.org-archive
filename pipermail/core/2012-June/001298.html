Hi,

I cloned Markus' submissions repo, and pushed a change to

  ocaml-4.00-bc-fixes

When you clone ocaml-core and apply the entire patch queue, everything up
through core compiles via ./build-and-install.  It falls over on
core_extended with the following error message

+ ocamlfind ocamlc -pack ..... -o lib/core_extended.cmo
ocamlc.opt got signal and exited

When I cd to base/core/extended and do

ocaml setup.ml -build

it builds cleanly though.  (The failing command also builds without a
problem when run by hand.)

Once core_extended is compiled by hand, the remaining libraries
compile and install via
build-and-install.

Recap:

hg clone ocaml-core
hg clone ocaml-core-submissions
ln -s $(pwd)/ocaml-core-submissions ocaml-core/.hg/patches
cd ocaml-core
hg qpush -a
./build-and-install # core succeeds, fails at core_extended
cd base/core/extended
ocaml setup.ml -build # succeeds
cd ../../..
./build-and-install # succeeds

I've tried for over an hour to figure out why it fails when called
from build-and-install, but not from ocaml setup.ml -build.  The
former script seems to simply call the later command, and I'm stuck.
If anyone has ideas what would be signaling the ocamlc.opt when run
from the script, I'd be happy to hear them.

I won't make this an official pull request until this issue is worked
out, but it seems the code changes are working.  (e.g. linux_ext and
posix_clock work).

Sean
