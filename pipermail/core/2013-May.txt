Subject: [core] Comparelib
Message-ID: <CAL4yAN=SQyxvDZZ+HFhQZQJhHiCS8vECW0YXQZ1LMG=5LgvtcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm sorting a list of int options using two methods:

1. Polymorphic compare
$ List.sort ~cmp:compare [Some 3; None; Some 2; Some 1];;
int option Core.Std.List.t = [None; Some 1; Some 2; Some 3]

2. Comparelib
List.sort ~cmp:<:compare<int option>> [Some 3; None; Some 2; Some 1];;
int option Core.Std.List.t = [Some 1; Some 2; Some 3; None]

It seems they treat None differently.

Why?

Is it not assumed to use comparelib for that kind of sorting?

Thanks
