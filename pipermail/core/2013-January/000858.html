If this means that there will be a monster patch that contains all
changes between two releases to Bitbucket, I'd actually be fine with
this.  It would still be great to have an up-to-date repository rather
than just tarballs.

&gt;<i> In terms of accepting patches, I think we should probably just start

This is understandable.  There is one downside though: a patch can
only be relative to a public release, since nobody knows the state of
your internal repository.  So why not just keep using the patch queue
with an up-to-date (as in: latest release) public repository?  It
would help people collaborate on patches, which would be much harder
if everybody had to read the list to see what patches are currently
being floated.

A possible release workflow for you could then be:

  * download patches from public patch queue
  * apply to your &quot;real&quot; internal tree, i.e. not your clone of the public one
  * review, improve, accept or reject
  * at release time just completely replace the contents of your clone
of the public repository with your newest release
  * commit and push this &quot;monster patch&quot; to the public repository
  * Remove all accepted or permanently rejected patches from the patch queue

I don't think people really care that much about the history of the
public release repository with messy monster patches.  They likely
just want to make sure their patches can somehow get in.

&gt;<i> For what it's worth, we've completely redone our internal dev
</I>&gt;<i> workflow, so that we new have a weekly release cycle for Jane, so we
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to get these patches through our internal process

</I>&gt;<i> gives very little benefit to people on the outside.
</I>
Sounds great.

Regards,
Markus
