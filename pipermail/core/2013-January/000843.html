</I>
Yup.  That's basically what I'm proposing.  I think an email patch
seems like the easiest thing to me, but I'm open to other ideas.

&gt;<i> This would mean every release will need to be manually reconciled on the
</I>&gt;<i> external export (and would lose precise version history), but would
</I>&gt;<i> significantly simplify the process of getting it onto Github/Bitbucket.
</I>
Yup.  As I said, Jeremie is in the process of doing this.

&gt;<i> I would personally really like to have a version on Github, as it's
</I>&gt;<i> so darn convenient just having all the code I work with in one place.
</I>&gt;<i> I just can't care enough about differences between the various DVCSs
</I>&gt;<i> enough to justify the different scripting and workflow required anymore.
</I>
Indeed.  We will export to both.

&gt;<i> Of course, that doesn't mean that JSC should stop using Bitbucket, but
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm happy to do the work to maintain a Hg-&gt;Git mirror, as I do
</I>&gt;<i> for SVN-&gt;Git for upstream OCaml.
</I>
I think we're going to export directly to both, but you should talk to
Jeremie about whether he'd be happier to use a mirror.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, our bitbucket setup hasn't been doing great.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FWIW, Yury went back and looked at the patches in your patchqueue, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we think they're all in (or a version of them is in, anyway) in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latest tarball.  They _haven't_ made it, sadly, into our bitbucket
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repo, because we roughly gave up on our system for generating that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jeremie Dimino is currently working on a new system for exporting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> releases to bitbucket, and we'll export them to git at the same time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of accepting patches, I think we should probably just start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accepting patch submissions over email, on this list.  That's probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the simplest workflow for us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For what it's worth, we've completely redone our internal dev
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workflow, so that we new have a weekly release cycle for Jane, so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be able to get these patches through our internal process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pretty fast.  We are thinking of making external releases once a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month, since the weekly release is more work for us, and probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gives very little benefit to people on the outside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jeremie hopes to have a new export process ready next week.
