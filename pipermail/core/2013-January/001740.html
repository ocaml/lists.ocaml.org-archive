We actually have our own internal system for managing code-review
requests (and like all of our tools, it's command-line rather than
web-based.  We hardly know how a web-browser works around here.)

I've never really understood how patch-oriented review systems were
supposed to work when your patch starts to encounter merge conflicts.
Do you end up reading diffs of patches as the patch evolves?  We've
actually done quite a bit of work on this very question, and it's
quite tricky.  How does Rietveld deal with this?

As a practical matter, I think that the workflow will be something like this:

- Patch gets emailed to this list
- A JS employee adds it to our internal CR system
- Code review continues internally, with issues resolved via email
communication to original author
- Once review is complete, patch goes out in the next scheduled release.

It's just too much work to bridge our internal and external systems in
any more formal way, I'm afraid.
