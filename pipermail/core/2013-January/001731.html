Yeah, our bitbucket setup hasn't been doing great.

FWIW, Yury went back and looked at the patches in your patchqueue, and
we think they're all in (or a version of them is in, anyway) in the
latest tarball.  They _haven't_ made it, sadly, into our bitbucket
repo, because we roughly gave up on our system for generating that.

Jeremie Dimino is currently working on a new system for exporting
releases to bitbucket, and we'll export them to git at the same time.
In terms of accepting patches, I think we should probably just start
accepting patch submissions over email, on this list.  That's probably
the simplest workflow for us.

For what it's worth, we've completely redone our internal dev
workflow, so that we new have a weekly release cycle for Jane, so we
should be able to get these patches through our internal process
pretty fast.  We are thinking of making external releases once a
month, since the weekly release is more work for us, and probably
gives very little benefit to people on the outside.

Jeremie hopes to have a new export process ready next week.
