<PRE>
Yaron and I also chatted at ICFP about how to best to export this for
outside contributions.

Since a CLA is required to send anything back to Core, I wonder if it's
best to simplify things with a read-only export, with contributions to
JSC going back via a patchqueue or email-patch that are signed off.

This would mean every release will need to be manually reconciled on the
external export (and would lose precise version history), but would
significantly simplify the process of getting it onto Github/Bitbucket.

I would personally really like to have a version on Github, as it's
so darn convenient just having all the code I work with in one place.
I just can't care enough about differences between the various DVCSs
enough to justify the different scripting and workflow required anymore.

Of course, that doesn't mean that JSC should stop using Bitbucket, but
that I'm happy to do the work to maintain a Hg-&gt;Git mirror, as I do
for SVN-&gt;Git for upstream OCaml.
