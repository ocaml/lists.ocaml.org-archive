<PRE>
With the OCaml toplevel and async scheduler running in different
threads, we need to guarantee that they don't interfere with each
other.  It is not necessary to stop the async scheduler; we just have
to prevent it from running while the toplevel is evaluating an input
expression.  This can be accomplished by having the toplevel hold the
async lock while it is evaluating an input expression, and is part of
what is done by wrapping the expression in [block_on_async_exn]:

  val block_on_async_exn : (unit -&gt; 'a Deferred.t) -&gt; 'a

[block_on_async_exn] also waits until the deferred becomes determined,
which may or may not be desirable.  The only key point for correctness
is the locking.  So, all we really need is [run_in_async_exn], which
acquires the lock, but does not block:

  val run_in_async_exn : (unit -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a

If people want the ability to block the async scheduler from running,
we could easily add the following functions to [Async.Thread_safe]:

  val  pause_scheduler : unit -&gt; unit
  val resume_scheduler : unit -&gt; unit

Calling [pause_scheduler] would block until it can acquire the async
lock, at which point the scheduler would be prevented from running.
One can then do whatever one wants, without interference from async,
and then, when one is finished, call [resume_scheduler].

But, I've never heard a need for these at Jane Street; we've been able
to get by with [{block_on,run_in}_async_exn].
