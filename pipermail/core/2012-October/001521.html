I've thought about that before, but didn't you answer that yourself a
few emails ago? What if one does an In_thread.run that blocks for some
time and then schedules a job?

But actually, I think this can gotten around. The criterion for
returning from the scheduler would be:

* No jobs on the job queue
* No fds being select()ed for writing
* The only fd being select()ed for reading is the interruptor
* No timer events
* No threads in the thread pool have work (Thread_pool.unfinished_work
is 0 -- this is currently not exposed, but I think it could be).

This adds the requirement that if one wants to create threads in
async, you must go through In_thread. At the moment, one could
presumably do a Core.Std.Thread.create that essentially reimplements
In_thread.run. It seems fine to disallow this. We'd probably want to
shadow Thread.create in the same way we do other verboten functions
from Core.

Stephen, what do you think?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   val  pause_scheduler : unit -&gt; unit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   val resume_scheduler : unit -&gt; unit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Calling [pause_scheduler] would block until it can acquire the async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lock, at which point the scheduler would be prevented from running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One can then do whatever one wants, without interference from async,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then, when one is finished, call [resume_scheduler].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, I've never heard a need for these at Jane Street; we've been able
