How much do you know about the performance and quality of libuv?  I'm
always nervous about shimming yet another layer between us and the
bare metal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm wondering if anyone has opinions on what we should do to make

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Porting to windows.  People have proposed using libuv to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Porting to non-Linux UNIX's: Right now, we depend on Core's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Linux_ext module.  I think the dependency is not deep, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  conditional compilation might be a way to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Support for other polling mechanisms: like epoll and friends.  Right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  now, it's all select.  A pluggable engine mechanism like the one Lwt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  has could make sense here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Interoperability with Lwt:  It would be nice to make Async and Lwt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  libraries play together.  Jeremie Dimino suggested that the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  thing here might be to build a library for Lwt on top of Async.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  That seems plausible enough, but an engine in the other direction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  might be good too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm curious if people have opinions as to how to best handle these.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm in particular wondering about conditional compilation as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution.  It seems messy, but I'm not sure what would be a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach.  One thing you could imagine is using first-class modules,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where you stored a system-dependent module that provided the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OS-specific functionality.  But there's some performance compromise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there (probably too small to matter compared to a system-call,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though), and I'm not sure it comes out cleaner.
