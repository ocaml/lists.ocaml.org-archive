I'm wondering if anyone has opinions on what we should do to make
Async more widely applicable.  Here are some issues that jump to mind.

- Porting to windows.  People have proposed using libuv to do that.
- Porting to non-Linux UNIX's: Right now, we depend on Core's
  Linux_ext module.  I think the dependency is not deep, so
  conditional compilation might be a way to fix that.
- Support for other polling mechanisms: like epoll and friends.  Right
  now, it's all select.  A pluggable engine mechanism like the one Lwt
  has could make sense here.
- Interoperability with Lwt:  It would be nice to make Async and Lwt
  libraries play together.  Jeremie Dimino suggested that the best
  thing here might be to build a library for Lwt on top of Async.
  That seems plausible enough, but an engine in the other direction
  might be good too.

I'm curious if people have opinions as to how to best handle these.
I'm in particular wondering about conditional compilation as a
solution.  It seems messy, but I'm not sure what would be a better
approach.  One thing you could imagine is using first-class modules,
where you stored a system-dependent module that provided the
OS-specific functionality.  But there's some performance compromise
there (probably too small to matter compared to a system-call,
though), and I'm not sure it comes out cleaner.
