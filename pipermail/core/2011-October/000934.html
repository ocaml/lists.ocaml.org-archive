You could combine most of these by basing Async on top of libuv, which is a superset of libev (the event library that Lwt uses to abstract network I/O).

<A HREF="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">https://github.com/joyent/libuv</A>

Crucially, libuv has good support for the Windows AIO model, and is also what node.js uses to drive its event loop (so has widespread usage).

At first glance at Core, it looks like many of the Linux-specific bits like high-res timers and thread scheduling are also covered by it.
