Hello,

Would it be possible to have a kind of Hoogle hosted somewhere
for OCaml?

I know one:
http://search.ocaml.jp/

But there is no async and core inside of it, despite
I asked for them (I did not ask in Japanese to the author, however).

Maybe that would be an amazing service offered by ocaml.org
to the community?

Thanks a lot,
F.

I would be extremely interested into reading some code written in this 
monad.

I also just want to log problems in my application, not always manage them 
online
and try to recover from them.

That's the kind of OCaml code you don't find that easily.
I hope there will be some in the "OCaml for the real world" upcoming book.

Thanks a lot,
F.

There are indeed some plans brewing to host documentation of various
libraries at ocaml.org.

Yep.  Francois, I'd encourage you to send this mail to infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org, so that we can start a conversation about what services will be provided and what barriers are in the way (for example, I notice that the OCaml version of Hoogle still depends on 3.11.0, and likely needs a major update).

Subject: Std.Semaphore ok for synchronizing multiprocess programs under
 Linux?
Message-ID: <7cc35a82-9058-4cad-9b34-5879c6aba7d0@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I'd like to use this module to synchronise writes
to a file in a Parmap.pariter call.

Is it OK to do so?

The semaphore will be created by the parent process,
then it will do V() on it,
each child process will do a P() then some work then V()

Thanks a lot,
F.

PS: I tried to use Unix.single_write but it does not work as I expected.
Also, since retrying many times the same operation hoping
for it to succeed is quite dumb (kind of STM-like behavior), I prefer a 
clean
semaphore solution.

PPS: would be really nice to be able to jumb from the ocamldoc to the 
corresponding
point in the source code...

Apparently after testing it, it is not for multi process programs, but for 
OCaml threads I guess.

The netsys lib from ocamlnet by Gerd Stolpmann<http://www.camlcity.org/contact.html>has POSIX semaphores.
It works well in my case.

Actually, to qualify this: OPAM's not broken for the "normal user" as it uses the mirrored OCamlPro archive by default. It's broken for me since I have a direct-download development repository, but I'm working around it by using the normal mirror instead.

Reopening this thread; would you consider adding adding an (|>) alias to core
alongside the existing (|!) ?

It has become the defacto standard with F#, and it would be nice to avoid
unnecessary divergence when explaining OCaml to beginners.

Hello,

Would it be possible to have a kind of Hoogle hosted somewhere
for OCaml?

I know one:
http://search.ocaml.jp/

But there is no async and core inside of it, despite
I asked for them (I did not ask in Japanese to the author, however).

Maybe that would be an amazing service offered by ocaml.org
to the community?

Thanks a lot,
F.

I would be extremely interested into reading some code written in this 
monad.

I also just want to log problems in my application, not always manage them 
online
and try to recover from them.

That's the kind of OCaml code you don't find that easily.
I hope there will be some in the "OCaml for the real world" upcoming book.

Thanks a lot,
F.

There are indeed some plans brewing to host documentation of various
libraries at ocaml.org.

Yep.  Francois, I'd encourage you to send this mail to infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org, so that we can start a conversation about what services will be provided and what barriers are in the way (for example, I notice that the OCaml version of Hoogle still depends on 3.11.0, and likely needs a major update).

Subject: Std.Semaphore ok for synchronizing multiprocess programs under
 Linux?
Message-ID: <7cc35a82-9058-4cad-9b34-5879c6aba7d0@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I'd like to use this module to synchronise writes
to a file in a Parmap.pariter call.

Is it OK to do so?

The semaphore will be created by the parent process,
then it will do V() on it,
each child process will do a P() then some work then V()

Thanks a lot,
F.

PS: I tried to use Unix.single_write but it does not work as I expected.
Also, since retrying many times the same operation hoping
for it to succeed is quite dumb (kind of STM-like behavior), I prefer a 
clean
semaphore solution.

PPS: would be really nice to be able to jumb from the ocamldoc to the 
corresponding
point in the source code...

Apparently after testing it, it is not for multi process programs, but for 
OCaml threads I guess.

The netsys lib from ocamlnet by Gerd Stolpmann<http://www.camlcity.org/contact.html>has POSIX semaphores.
It works well in my case.

Actually, to qualify this: OPAM's not broken for the "normal user" as it uses the mirrored OCamlPro archive by default. It's broken for me since I have a direct-download development repository, but I'm working around it by using the normal mirror instead.

Reopening this thread; would you consider adding adding an (|>) alias to core

It has become the defacto standard with F#, and it would be nice to avoid
