<PRE>That's so good. Can't wait to see it.

</I>&gt;<i> As for comparing Lwt and Async, I think I discussed some of the issues 
</I>&gt;<i> on the caml list when Async came out, but the short version is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) very similar core design
</I>&gt;<i> 2) much less C code in Async
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Monitors instead of stuffing errors in the monads
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Async has more disciplined distribution of unhandled exceptions, 
</I>&gt;<i> and a more disciplined interleaving model
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Lwt has more hooks into the outside world and is more widely used
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (4) is a complicated one to explain, so perhaps that's one to expand 
</I>&gt;<i> upon in a blog post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stephen also wrote up a detailed comparison of Async and Lwt right 
</I>&gt;<i> before the release, which perhaps we should also clean up and post.

</I>&gt;<i>     Agreed, and a post contrasting Lwt and Async would be most
