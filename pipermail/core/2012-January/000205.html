</I>
Bitbucket's user authentication is pretty orthogonal, as patches come in
through Mercurial. The DVCSes separate the committer from the author, so
that it can be applied by a project committer (of which Xen only has 3)
and patches can come from the general public (of which Xen has 100s of
different patch sources).

This permits you to nominate a trusted core (no pun intended) of people
who can apply changes to the main repository, and they also check that the
patch came from a sensible source. The Acked-By mechanism lets subsystem
maintainers also certify it on the way through.

All of this is only useful in two cases: 1) you're trying to track down a
bug, and you can auto-bisect from a known-good working changeset and find
a set of people to blame. 2) is that there is an IPR contest over a
particular patch, and you can both remove that code, and also understand
why the people who authorized it failed to spot the error.

</I>
The DCO isn't perfect, but it's got the big advantage that it doesn't have
an unnecessary contract to sign as the CLA does.  Most engineers would
either just sign a contract (no clear personal damages, and they are
limited liablity if at work) or not bother contributing code as going
through legal is too much hassle.

Either way, the real question is what you're trying to protect yourself
against in all this. If (as I suspect) you want to avoid tainting your
so-far pristine codebase with potentially plagiarised code, then setting
up a system that lets you rollback the bad bits is far more important than
getting people to sign a contract. The DCO does this, and it's no accident
that Linux and Xen both handle a hugely complex IPR situation without
getting lawyers involved. How often have you seen IBM, Microsoft, AMD,
Intel and HP all submit patches to a shared codebase without (much) drama?
We can only dream of getting OCaml Core to such giddy heights :-)

&gt;<i> Honestly, I'd rather not have submissions from people who aren't allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute by their employer, and requiring people to sign a CLA seems to
</I>&gt;<i> improve the chance that people get this right.
</I>
You should be extremely wary of people who do not have the rights to
submit code, but the DCO covers this as explicitly as the CLA.
