<PRE>I guess I hadn't fully understood your earlier proposal.  I had thought
that the signed-off idea was a protection in addition to signing a CLA, but
now looking back I realize the intent is that it be instead.

But what's the advantage?  In terms of traceability of patches, I've been
thinking that bitbucket's user authentication would be sufficient, since
we'd have the name of the author of each patch clearly visible.  As a
pragmatic matter, it seems like that would identify users to us and allow
us to back out changes if need be.

I guess signing an agreement is somewhat onerous, and I agree that they
might not be able to sign such an agreement, depending on the agreements
they have with their employers.  But the &quot;Developers Certificate of
Origin&quot;, which people are implicitly signing on to, seems to carry the same
problem.  And having people actually sign the agreement seems to improve
the chance that people are actually paying attention to the rules and
following whatever their IP restrictions are.

Honestly, I'd rather not have submissions from people who aren't allowed to
contribute by their employer, and requiring people to sign a CLA seems to
improve the chance that people get this right.
