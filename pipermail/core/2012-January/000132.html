<PRE>That's a totally reasonable request.  We have some internal documentation
that might be worth brushing up and putting out on the wiki.  I'll see if I
can get that up today, and then we can think about where people would like
to see expanded documentation.

As for comparing Lwt and Async, I think I discussed some of the issues on
the caml list when Async came out, but the short version is:

1) very similar core design
2) much less C code in Async
3) Monitors instead of stuffing errors in the monads
4) Async has more disciplined distribution of unhandled exceptions, and a
more disciplined interleaving model
5) Lwt has more hooks into the outside world and is more widely used

(4) is a complicated one to explain, so perhaps that's one to expand upon
in a blog post.

Stephen also wrote up a detailed comparison of Async and Lwt right before
the release, which perhaps we should also clean up and post.
