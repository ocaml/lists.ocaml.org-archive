There's a reasonable amount of Lwt C code to deal with the 'detached'
threads which are mapped to pthreads. That's unfortunately necessary for
the synchronous APIs in *NIX like DNS resolution and disk I/O. Luckily not
such a big deal for my particular use case.

The actual socket handling in the Lwt UNIX backend is also quite complex
OCaml code, but this appear to be due to the need for cancellation to free
resources like fds when Lwt.cancel is invoked (cancellation is another
area of Lwt thats hard to use, but is generally hard with cooperative
threads, and it sounds like monitors may be an easier solution).

Overall, both Async and Lwt are pretty good about implementing the
majority of their logic in safe OCaml.  One of my favourite things about
Lwt is how it explicitly has a src/core directory with the pure code, and
src/unix with all the evaluation modules to drive the cothreads. It makes
porting it to different platforms (or microkernels!) in stages an absolute
breeze.
