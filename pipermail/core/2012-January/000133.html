</I>&gt;<i> 3) and 4) are definitely interesting and great points in Async's favour.
</I> In our use of Lwt, exception propagation and the interface with normal
OCaml exceptions have been the most problematic parts of its design,
particularly with respect to space leaks due to exception handlers holding
onto values unexpectedly.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) is perhaps a bit of of a low blow, since all the Async C code is
</I>hidden in Core :-) There isn't a particularly large disparity between the
two if you include Core in the count.

Stephen read over lwt and was quite surprised by the amount and nature of
the c code, so on that basis I don't think this is just a line-accounting
trick.  The c code in core is largely wrapping system calls.  But I believe
that Stephen was saying that significant fractions of the complexity of the
runtime are in C.  Stephen, can you elaborate?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a totally reasonable request.  We have some internal

 I'll see if I can get that up today, and then we can think about where
people would like to see expanded documentation.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for comparing Lwt and Async, I think I discussed some of the issues
</I>on the caml list when Async came out, but the short version is:
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) very similar core design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) much less C code in Async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Monitors instead of stuffing errors in the monads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Async has more disciplined distribution of unhandled exceptions, and
</I>a more disciplined interleaving model
&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Lwt has more hooks into the outside world and is more widely used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (4) is a complicated one to explain, so perhaps that's one to expand
</I>upon in a blog post.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stephen also wrote up a detailed comparison of Async and Lwt right
</I>before the release, which perhaps we should also clean up and post.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed, and a post contrasting Lwt and Async would be most gratefully
</I>received. Bonus points for the (hopefully simple) adapter code between Lwt
and Async to let them both co-exist in the same event loop.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I see that in the ocaml-core repository at Bitbucket, there are

in my opinion, the primary concepts in  Async, such as stream, monitor, and
the underlying threading model as well as the design principles needs more
examples and illustration so that Async can be more widely used outside
Jane Street.
