Cancellation is really tricky to get right. I think the correct choice
in many circumstances is to not support it at all, and instead use
some other mechanism when needed.

Concurrent ML presents a very nice solution to threads that require
cancellation: event synchronization is atomic. However, they don't
compose as well as futures do: For example, synchronization isn't
transitive across multiple processes.

What we ended up doing in Finagle[1], which I think worked out very
well, was to not support cancellation, but rather a cancellation
*signal* that flows in the opposite direction from value propagation. The
signal is level triggered, and any interested party can listen to it.
The propagation composes in the expected way (opposite in direction
from the value).

In other words:

  let composed = foo &gt;&gt;= (fun _ -&gt; bar)

propagates cancellation signals on `composed' to `bar', just like values
are propagated from `bar' to `composed'.

You can then listen to the signal (in scala:

  on_cancellation bar (fun () -&gt; (* whatever you like *))

The nice thing about this approach is that only the updater of the
value need worry about cancellation, and we can use this to guarantee
that there's *only one update path*. This actually solves all of the
try &#8230; catch problems, because if there is cancellation, the signal
makes it all the way to the updater of the future, and *it* can decide
what to do. We introduced cancellation in this way about 6 months ago,
and there have yet to be any bugs surfaced from it.

btw: if Pipes weren't buffered, they'd essentially be CML's channels
