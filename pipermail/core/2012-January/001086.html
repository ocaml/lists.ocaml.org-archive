<PRE>Yeah, as most engineering contributors from companies wont have direct signing authority. So even if they *do* sign it as a personal thing, chances are their companies have a claim on their IPR.

I've been through this before for FSF patches for gcc, and it was painful enough.  It may be easier now since Apache is well known, but really, why bother with all this?  If you do get a bad egg who signs this agreement, what recourse do you have against them in practise? And if there's no recourse, what's the purpose of the agreement?  Establishing a provenance trail is way more important so you can *undo* patches that later prove bad, and that's what Signed-off-by is all about.

</I>&gt;<i> Again, I just want to highlight my concerns with putting barriers in place for outside contributors. I'm also very against assigning my copyright to someone else for free software (its different for commercial software of course).  This would make it painful for another company to depend on Core as legal would have to get involved to sign the indemnity.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are a number of outstanding pull requests, and I wanted to mention that I'm holding off on including them mostly because we don't yet have a contributor license agreement set up.  We're working on this now, but I just wanted people to understand what the holdup is.
