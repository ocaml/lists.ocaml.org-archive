I don't think it's quite necessary.  We deal with the same issues without
the C code.

We actually don't support cancellation of monitors, although it's easy to
implement, because of the complexity of cancellation semantics (how do you
deal with try-protect type idioms, for example?)

Look in bitbucket!   That is in fact a great idea, and Stephen rearranged
Async to follow the same design.
