<PRE>&gt;<i> 2) is perhaps a bit of of a low blow, since all the Async C code is
</I>&gt;<i> hidden in Core :-) There isn't a particularly large disparity
</I>&gt;<i> between the two if you include Core in the count.
</I>..
&gt;<i> Stephen read over lwt and was quite surprised by the amount and
</I>&gt;<i> nature of the c code, so on that basis I don't think this is just a
</I>&gt;<i> line-accounting trick.  The c code in core is largely wrapping
</I>&gt;<i> system calls.  But I believe that Stephen was saying that
</I>&gt;<i> significant fractions of the complexity of the runtime are in C.
</I>&gt;<i> Stephen, can you elaborate?
</I>
Core has approx 3k lines of C code, most of which isn't relevant to
Async.  If I had to write C bindings for Async from scratch without
using Core, I guess it would come in comfortably under 1k lines, maybe
even under 500.  One just needs basic wrappers for system calls (read,
write, select) and OCaml's existing Thread API.  The Async scheduler
and job handling are all implemented in OCaml using those.

LWT has approx 6k lines of C code, of which 5k lives in
lwt_unix_unix.c and lwt_unix_stubs.c.  I'm far from an expert on LWT,
but it does appear that much of that code has to do with the scheduler
and job handling.

&gt;<i> There's a reasonable amount of Lwt C code to deal with the 'detached'
</I>&gt;<i> threads which are mapped to pthreads. That's unfortunately necessary for
</I>&gt;<i> the synchronous APIs in *NIX like DNS resolution and disk I/O
</I>
I think this does not imply a need for lots of C code.  OCaml has a
thread API, and Async has OCaml code that uses threads to make
blocking calls (like DNS resolution and disk I/O).  Having a basic C
wrapper around the blocking call that releases the OCaml lock is
sufficient.  With that, one can do the rest in OCaml.

&gt;<i> The actual socket handling in the Lwt UNIX backend is also quite complex
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml code, but this appear to be due to the need for cancellation to free
</I>&gt;<i> resources like fds when Lwt.cancel is invoked
</I>
Again, I think this does not imply a need for lots of C code.  Async
supports interruptible socket operations, and frees up file
descriptors when the interrupt happens.  Of course, one needs access
to system calls, but the logic can be (and is, in Async) written in
OCaml.

&gt;<i> One of my favourite things about Lwt is how it explicitly has a
</I>&gt;<i> src/core directory with the pure code, and src/unix with all the
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation modules to drive the cothreads. It makes porting it to
</I>&gt;<i> different platforms (or microkernels!) in stages an absolute breeze.
</I>...
&gt;<i> That is in fact a great idea, and Stephen rearranged Async to follow
</I>&gt;<i> the same design.
</I>
Yeah, I really liked that about LWT, and now that I copied the approach in
Async, I like that about Async too :-)
