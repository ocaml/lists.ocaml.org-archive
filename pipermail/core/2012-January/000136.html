<PRE>3) and 4) are definitely interesting and great points in Async's favour.  In our use of Lwt, exception propagation and the interface with normal OCaml exceptions have been the most problematic parts of its design, particularly with respect to space leaks due to exception handlers holding onto values unexpectedly.

2) is perhaps a bit of of a low blow, since all the Async C code is hidden in Core :-) There isn't a particularly large disparity between the two if you include Core in the count.

</I>&gt;<i> 3) Monitors instead of stuffing errors in the monads

</I>&gt;<i> 5) Lwt has more hooks into the outside world and is more widely used
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) is a complicated one to explain, so perhaps that's one to expand upon in a blog post.

</I>&gt;<i> Stephen also wrote up a detailed comparison of Async and Lwt right before the release, which perhaps we should also clean up and post.

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, and a post contrasting Lwt and Async would be most gratefully received. Bonus points for the (hopefully simple) adapter code between Lwt and Async to let them both co-exist in the same event loop.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see that in the ocaml-core repository at Bitbucket, there are several examples about using Async, which is of great help for users. But in my opinion, the primary concepts in  Async, such as stream, monitor, and the underlying threading model as well as the design principles needs more examples and illustration so that Async can be more widely used outside Jane Street.
