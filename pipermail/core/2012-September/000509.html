</I>&gt;<i> Your code is already correct in the case of early termination by the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.s. I see in your code that you open Deferred. Why is this? All of

David, thanks for all these hints.  I was opening Deferred due to missing
the Async.Std, so I've reverted all that now.

&gt;<i> Also, two more stylistic points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If the code on the right-hand side of a bind does not return a
</I>&gt;<i> deferred, it is common to use &gt;&gt;| instead of &gt;&gt;=, and then delete all
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;return&quot;s on the right-hand side. E.g. in read_response.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. All code between two binds is guaranteed to execute atomically,
</I>&gt;<i> without being interleaved with any other code. This is a very nice
</I>&gt;<i> feature of async, and really simplifies thinking about concurrent
</I>&gt;<i> code. Because of this, it is idiomatic to put all of your binds
</I>&gt;<i> flush-left, so that they stick out visually. (This is not quite
</I>&gt;<i> universal in our code base, but is certainly to be encouraged.) You
</I>&gt;<i> can see that in my snippet above.

Ack.  I've been tidying up <A HREF="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp">http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp</A> to work
across Async, Lwt_unix and Mirage via functors. The result is a reasonably
good HTTP/1.1 (w/ pipelining) client/server for all these threading
systems.

Many of my other thoughts on Async shortcomings seem to be addressed by
the upcoming new release (such as Async equivalents of Core modules such
as Option.  I'll play around with them shortly.

I'm just going to finish up SSL bindings for Async to get it to
feature-parity with the Lwt version, and then port the Github API bindings
(<A HREF="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github</A>).  It's quite useful having two
different threading libraries to really force a good structure between
protocol modules.

Most of these will be packaged up in OPAM by the end of the week, for our
upcoming CUFP tutorial next week.
