Sigh, this is out of date. This was probably written before we split
async into three parts: the core, the unix-dependent bits, and
&quot;extra&quot;, everything else.

So one might imagine that reading each of
async/{core,unix,extra}/std.ml might be a good idea. But it turns out
they're basically commentless.

I didn't realise quite how bad the state of our documentation was --
I'll try to find some time to work on it.

There is some stuff in examples/, but sadly some of that is out of
date as well. It's not worthless though, especially if you consider a
couple of points that might help modernise the code:

1. Prefer pipes over streams -- they have different semantics, but
Pipe's are nicer, and it can be pretty easy to make mistakes with
Streams.

2. Prefer &gt;&gt;= over upon/&gt;&gt;&gt;. There is a pretty simple translation:

foo
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fun a -&gt;
</I>bar
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fun b -&gt;
</I>baz
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fun c -&gt;
</I>quux

-&gt;

foo
&gt;&gt;<i>= fun a -&gt;
</I>bar
&gt;&gt;<i>= fun b -&gt;
</I>baz
&gt;&gt;|<i> fun c -&gt;
</I>quux

This gives the whole block a deferred result type. For library
functions, this is only really a good thing, since your callers can
bind on the result, or can throw it away with [whenever] if they don't
want to wait for your function to finish (whenever is soon to be
renamed don't_wait_for).

For blocks at the top-level of your code, there isn't as much benefit
(you don't have any callers), but it's still nice to do it for
consistency.

[A bit more background for the interested:

It used to be the case that recursive loops written with bind, e.g.:

  let loop () =
    if predicate then Deferred.unit else
      Clock.after (sec 1.)
      &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
      loop ()

would take space proportional to the depth of recursion. So one would
have to write using upon, where

  let loop () =
    if predicate then () else
      Clock.after (sec 1.)
      &gt;&gt;&gt; fun () -&gt;
      loop ()

and you had no way of telling when the loop was done -- if you wanted
to do that, you had to create the deferred explicitly:

  Deferred.create (fun ivar -&gt;
    let loop () =
      if predicate then Ivar.fill ivar () else
        Clock.after (sec 1.)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; fun () -&gt;
        loop ()))

But this is no longer necessary, and the bind loop should be
considered the best style in almost all circumstances. The reason is a
really neat trick, but this email is already too long -- I'll try to
write a blog post about it.
