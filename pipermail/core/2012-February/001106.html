<PRE>A bunch of new code has just landed in the repo.  This includes some
portability fixes, as well as the change to make platform-dependent
functionality show up as Or_error.t's.  Try it out and report problems!

As a general matter, we're currently doing a big code-review cycle
internally.  That should be done in a few weeks, at which point, we should
be able to cut a proper release, with tarballs and all that goodness.
 Hopefully we can get more portability fixes in as well.

(There's some other fun stuff that lands with this.  One example: Sweeks
did some work to expose the fact that the monomorphic sets and maps, e.g.,
Int.Map.t, and the polymorphic maps, are really the same thing and so can
be acted on polymorphically.  At the same time, he added a phantom type so
that you can't try to do a Set.union or a Map.merge on things that happen
to have the same type, but one was built with polymorphic compare and one
wasn't....)
