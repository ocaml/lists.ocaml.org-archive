I guess contributors could use some tricks to make life easier, but in
the end I prefer a predictable workflow that avoids pitfalls.

I assume you have considered some sort of &quot;forest&quot; approach with
sub-repositories for open source code in your tree?  I have never
tried those myself, but it presumably didn't work for you.  At least
conceptually it would seem like a good solution.

&gt;<i> We're going to try to make the turn-around for submissions faster,

I'll do so right away.  It's mostly the new sexplib features (record
field defaults, new comment syntax, etc.).

&gt;<i> We're also on the verge of releasing a tarball that should be MUCH
</I>&gt;<i> easier to install. &#160;In particular, you will no longer need to install
</I>&gt;<i> Oasis: you can just download a single tarball and install. &#160;We'll also
</I>&gt;<i> put out individual tarballs for all the sub-libraries, for those who
</I>&gt;<i> wish to pick and choose.
</I>
Sounds good, this will surely lower the barrier for people unfamiliar
with Oasis.

&gt;<i> (It's actually on the bitbucket download site now, but I want to put
</I>&gt;<i> in a useful README before encouraging people to try it out. &#160;That
</I>&gt;<i> should happen tomorrow.)
</I>
Great, I'm looking forward to that.

Btw., I'm about to rewrite the READMEs of all my libraries in the
Bitbucket compatible markdown format (Python markdown with some
extensions).  It's unfortunately not compatible with pandoc, but seems
pretty nice anyway.  Are you considering switching to this format,
too, for your open source libraries?  I especially like that it
supports syntax highlighting for OCaml code in markdown files.

Regards,
Markus
