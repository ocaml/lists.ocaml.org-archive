</I>
Yeah, we considered it, but it was just too painful for internal
reasons.

&gt;&gt;<i> We're going to try to make the turn-around for submissions faster,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which should reduce the pain associated with all of this. &#160;We just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pulled in all of your latest pull request, and if you have more you'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to submit, you can add it in and we should be able to get it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pretty quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll do so right away. &#160;It's mostly the new sexplib features (record
</I>&gt;<i> field defaults, new comment syntax, etc.).
</I>
Where did we end up on the record field defaults?  Had we settled on a
feature-set there?  I guess I'll just look at the docs in the README
to refresh myself.

&gt;&gt;<i> We're also on the verge of releasing a tarball that should be MUCH
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to install. &#160;In particular, you will no longer need to install
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oasis: you can just download a single tarball and install. &#160;We'll also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put out individual tarballs for all the sub-libraries, for those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wish to pick and choose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good, this will surely lower the barrier for people unfamiliar
</I>&gt;<i> with Oasis.
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> (It's actually on the bitbucket download site now, but I want to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a useful README before encouraging people to try it out. &#160;That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should happen tomorrow.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great, I'm looking forward to that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw., I'm about to rewrite the READMEs of all my libraries in the
</I>&gt;<i> Bitbucket compatible markdown format (Python markdown with some
</I>&gt;<i> extensions). &#160;It's unfortunately not compatible with pandoc, but seems
</I>&gt;<i> pretty nice anyway. &#160;Are you considering switching to this format,
</I>&gt;<i> too, for your open source libraries? &#160;I especially like that it
</I>&gt;<i> supports syntax highlighting for OCaml code in markdown files.
</I>
I'd much prefer to stick to something compatible with pandoc.  We use
it for all of our internal document generation.  Is there any reason
to prefer this python library?
