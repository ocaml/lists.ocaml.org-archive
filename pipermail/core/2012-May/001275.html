Hi,

have you guys thought about creating a central patch queue for
ocaml-core?  I think the merge-related issues discussed previously
could be solved most easily if you maintained a central patch queue
repository.

I've just played around with my own Bitbucket patch queue of my fork,
and it seems to work just fine.  This allows me to avoid merging with
your repo by &quot;rebasing&quot;, i.e. doing a &quot;hg qpop -a&quot;, &quot;hg pull -u&quot; (from
your repo), &quot;hg qpush -a&quot;.

But one problem still remains: how to submit patches to your
repository.  In the moment I commit my patches to my tree for you to
pull, there might be a race condition where you change your tree, thus
forcing a potentially bad merge.  This will eventually become a major
problem as the number of contributors grows.  Accepting pull requests
will obviously change your tree and thus increase chances for race
conditions with others.

The improved workflow would make sure that people never commit changes
to the main repository.  Instead they:

  * Fork your central patch queue instead of the ocaml-core repo.  You
will never accept pull requests for the latter!
  * Add new patches with &quot;qnew&quot;.
  * Update them with &quot;qrefresh&quot; as they keep improving them.
  * Pull from your patch queue (rebasing their patches).
  * Commit their patches to their patch repository via &quot;hg commit --mq&quot;
  * Push them to their fork of your patch queue (hg push --mq)
  * Send pull requests to your central patch queue

Contributors will never run &quot;qfinish&quot; to apply patches to the main
repo.  Applying the patches will be your privilege after accepting
pull requests for the patch queue repo.  I think this will also make
your job of merging patches easier, because it is trivial to verify
that the main repository is untouched, i.e. that only the patch repo
contains changes.

I haven't tested the whole workflow yet, but it worked as expected for
me for those parts that I did test.  Please let me know if you want to
create a patch queue and test this approach with me.

Regards,
Markus
