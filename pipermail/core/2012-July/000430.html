Hello,

For the moment, the best answer I got privately in my mailbox
is to combine Janestreet's bin_prot and async libraries
or Martin Jambon's biniou with Lwt.

I kind of like what I read on async and bin_prot.

 &gt; Hi.

 &gt; I also had need of such a library when I started working on a
 &gt; distributed programming project, but as I couldn't find anything that
 &gt; fulfilled my requirements, I wrote my own.
 &gt;
 &gt; The library is Lwt-based, and provides pretty straightforward remotely
 &gt; callable procedures:
 &gt;
 &gt; type ('a, 'r) handle
 &gt; val ($) : ('a, 'r) handle -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'r Lwt.t
 &gt; val publish : ('a -&gt; 'r Lwt.t) -&gt; ('a, 'r) handle
 &gt;
 &gt; The library is designed to work in a firewalled environment: firewalled
 &gt; nodes can join the distributed network by connecting to any accessible
 &gt; host of that network with an open listener. All messages between nodes
 &gt; are routed through the network.
 &gt;
 &gt; type connection
 &gt; val connect :
 &gt; ?host:string -&gt; ?port:int -&gt; unit -&gt; connection Lwt.t
 &gt; val listen :
 &gt; ?port:int -&gt; unit -&gt; unit Lwt.t
 &gt;
 &gt; Initial values are obtained with &quot;roots&quot;. A root (usually a handle, or a
 &gt; record or first-class module containing handles) is keyed to a string,
 &gt; and once set by a node, it can be discovered by any node in the network:
 &gt;
 &gt; val get_root : string -&gt; 'a Lwt.t
 &gt; val set_root : string -&gt; 'a -&gt; unit Lwt.t
 &gt;
 &gt; This is the only unsafe part of the interface: the getter and setter
 &gt; _must_ agree on the type of the root or all hell breaks loose.
 &gt;
 &gt; I haven't published the library yet, since I have wanted to feel free to
 &gt; modify it as required by my application, but if you are interested, and
 &gt; cannot find a more mature solution, I'd be happy to provide it for your
 &gt; inspection.

If you publish your code somewhere (github is really nice), I would
be very happy to have a look at it.

Thanks a lot,
F.
