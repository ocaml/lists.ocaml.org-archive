<PRE>Thank you for the responses.  I'm probably going to switch to the &gt;&gt;=, &gt;&gt;&gt;,
&gt;&gt;|<i> operators.  I wasn't sure if I liked them when I first started but I'll
</I>try them out.  They will probably be clearer now that I have had time to
think about the code in terms of bind and upon.

For the upon code, in gen_server_test.ml that should be switched to bind, I
agree.  In gen_server.ml, I use upon to represent the event loop, which
represents a detached computation so nobody should ever wait on that  I
think the use of upon there is valid, but let me know if you disagree.

For the original problem I raised, about a gen server being able to
reference itself, the best solution I've come up with is passing the init
function a tuple of (msg -&gt; unit * exited Ivar.t).  The init function can
give this tuple to other services it wants to create.  I'm still not a big
fan of it though, but my Ocaml-type-fu is weak.

Thanks again

</I>&gt;<i> Not sure I totally agree -- I think Deferred.return is a clearer name

</I>&gt;<i> using map instead of bind as the last chained infix operator, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   foo
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;= fun a -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   bar a
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   baz
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;| fun c -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   quux c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This also shows another style point I'm a fan of: arrange your code
</I>&gt;<i> with binds/maps on the left, so that it is clear where they all are.
</I>&gt;<i> This is important, because they're basically the possible context
</I>&gt;<i> switch points in your code. So you should be aware where they are. The
</I>&gt;<i> above example looks silly, but generally you have much longer lines
</I>&gt;<i> between the binds, and it looks fine.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Generally functions that do deferred things should generally have a
</I>&gt;<i> Deferred
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type. Don't use upon to try to give yourself functions of type 'unit'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> +1, and in fact I'd say any use of upon is supicious. Note that [x &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> f] is equivalent (pretty much) to [whenever (x &gt;&gt;= f)] (at some point
</I>&gt;<i> we are renaming &quot;whenever&quot; to &quot;don't_wait_for&quot; -- I can't remember
</I>&gt;<i> whether that has hit yet). But as you say, you should just let things
</I>&gt;<i> have deferred return types if they do deferred things. This means that
</I>&gt;<i> clients of that function have the choice whether to wait for that
</I>&gt;<i> function (by binding on it), or not to (by calling
</I>&gt;<i> whenever/don't_wait_for).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only exception is very tight loops, where upon is more efficient
</I>&gt;<i> than bind, because it avoids allocating an extra deferred.
