<PRE>I haven't had a chance to take a very long look, but I do have a few 
comments. Feel free to ignore me if I'm misunderstanding what you're trying 
to do :).

You're refererencing some things in Async's Deferred module (like 
'Deferred.return', etc) with their qualified names, which is unnecessary: 
you can just use 'return'. This is partially a style point, but Deferred is 
generally understood to be the top-level monad if you have Async open. 
(This is also the case for some functions in other modules, like printf, 
which is in the top level in Core.)

You're also using the named 'bind', 'upon', etc. Unless there's a good 
reason to do that, I'd use the inline operators instead--they're much nicer 
to read. (&gt;&gt;= is bind, &gt;&gt;&gt; is upon, &gt;&gt;| is map) For example, with minimal 
other changes, this is how I'd write your 'test_gen_server' function:

let test_gen_server () =
  Test_server.start 0
  &gt;&gt;&gt; function
  | Result.Error _ -&gt; shutdown 2
  | Result.Ok gs   -&gt;
    incr gs 1;
    incr gs 2;
    Ivar.read (get gs) 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; function
    | 3 -&gt; shutdown gs
    | n -&gt;
      eprintf &quot;Error: Got %d\n&quot; n; (* eprintf goes to stderr instead of 
stdout *)
      Shutdown.shutdown 1

Also, I see a lot of use of upon, return, and ivars. There are certainly 
times to use all of them, but there are often nicer abstractions already in 
Async that do the hard work for you. Take a look at the Pipe module: I 
think you'll be able to eliminate a lot of code (and better types for your 
own interfaces will flow much more naturally from the underlying types). 
Generally functions that do deferred things should generally have a 
Deferred type. Don't use upon to try to give yourself functions of type 
'unit'.
