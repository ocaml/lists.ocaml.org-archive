Not sure I totally agree -- I think Deferred.return is a clearer name
than return on its own. I generally try to avoid use of return by
using map instead of bind as the last chained infix operator, e.g.:

  foo
  &gt;&gt;= fun a -&gt;
  bar a
  &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
  baz
  &gt;&gt;| fun c -&gt;
  quux c

(This also shows another style point I'm a fan of: arrange your code
with binds/maps on the left, so that it is clear where they all are.
This is important, because they're basically the possible context
switch points in your code. So you should be aware where they are. The
above example looks silly, but generally you have much longer lines
between the binds, and it looks fine.)

&gt;<i> Generally functions that do deferred things should generally have a Deferred
</I>&gt;<i> type. Don't use upon to try to give yourself functions of type 'unit'.
</I>
+1, and in fact I'd say any use of upon is supicious. Note that [x &gt;&gt;&gt;
f] is equivalent (pretty much) to [whenever (x &gt;&gt;= f)] (at some point
we are renaming &quot;whenever&quot; to &quot;don't_wait_for&quot; -- I can't remember
whether that has hit yet). But as you say, you should just let things
have deferred return types if they do deferred things. This means that
clients of that function have the choice whether to wait for that
function (by binding on it), or not to (by calling
whenever/don't_wait_for).

The only exception is very tight loops, where upon is more efficient
than bind, because it avoids allocating an extra deferred.
