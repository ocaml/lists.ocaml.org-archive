Yeah, two backends would work if they both have users (Jane Street for the
direct one, and the &quot;community&quot; for the libuv one). I imagine they would
converge as confidence grows (or not) in one or the other.

&gt;<i> I agree that a general-purpose pluggable engine sounds like it would

</I>
Agreed. It would certainly make the various *BSD and Windows ports much
more tractable.
