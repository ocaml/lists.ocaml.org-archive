That's not a crazy idea.  As I said, it's a little hard to imagine
that we'd want to run our own apps through libuv, but I could imagine
it as an alternate backend.

I agree that a general-purpose pluggable engine sounds like it would
cause trouble.  But maybe we can get to supporting two backends.
