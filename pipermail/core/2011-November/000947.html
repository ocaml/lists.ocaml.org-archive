<PRE>A pluggable engine will give you the lowest common denominator and/or a poorly tested set of alternatives (most users will just one the default one). There are observable differences between the backends (e.g. select returns immediately if you pass in a block device fd, whereas epoll can often wedge forever and never return).

The reason I like libuv is because its most aligned with the Core &quot;full service&quot; feature set, whereas the rest are mostly just network I/O.  Node.js is very similar in terms of its runtime architecture to Core+Async (C non-blocking runtime, language VM activations).  Letting that community deal with platform portability would save a lot of time.
 
I've written servers in both libevent and libev, and they are both pretty good for network AIO. The scalability differences between them won't matter for 99% of users.

</I>&gt;<i> But even once you agree you need one of these libraries, it's till not clear to me how to pick amongst libev, libuv and libevent.  libevent seems like the most mature, libev is claimed (by the author anyway) to be more efficient, and libuv seems to treat Windows as a first-class citizen.  This is to some degree why I like the idea of a pluggable engine, which would prevent us from needing to commit to a single answer.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm wondering if anyone has opinions on what we should do to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Async more widely applicable.  Here are some issues that jump to mind.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Porting to windows.  People have proposed using libuv to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Porting to non-Linux UNIX's: Right now, we depend on Core's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  Linux_ext module.  I think the dependency is not deep, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  conditional compilation might be a way to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Support for other polling mechanisms: like epoll and friends.  Right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  now, it's all select.  A pluggable engine mechanism like the one Lwt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  has could make sense here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Interoperability with Lwt:  It would be nice to make Async and Lwt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  libraries play together.  Jeremie Dimino suggested that the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  thing here might be to build a library for Lwt on top of Async.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  That seems plausible enough, but an engine in the other direction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  might be good too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious if people have opinions as to how to best handle these.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm in particular wondering about conditional compilation as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; solution.  It seems messy, but I'm not sure what would be a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; approach.  One thing you could imagine is using first-class modules,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; where you stored a system-dependent module that provided the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; OS-specific functionality.  But there's some performance compromise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; there (probably too small to matter compared to a system-call,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; though), and I'm not sure it comes out cleaner.
