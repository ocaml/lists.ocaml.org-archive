I'd certainly be interested in seeing snippets; the specific OMakefiles
would likely have to be ported to ocamlbuild to work with OASIS, so having
the whole thing released probably isn't worth the effort.

</I>
Thanks for confirming. I'll poke and prod ocamlbuild next week to see if I
can convince it to not include the code.
