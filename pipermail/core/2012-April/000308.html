Hi,

I have fixed a long-standing shortcoming of the S-expression library.
When the S-expression syntax was conceived, the future popularity of
Sexplib wasn't anticipated.  This lead to the omission of block
comments, which makes it considerably harder to comment out sections
in S-expression files.  Scheme/Lisp also introduced another kind of
comment a few years ago, which allows users to quickly comment out
syntactically correct S-expressions.

These two new syntactic constructs for introducing comments are now in
my fork of Sexplib (Core) and work as follows (mostly similar to
popular Lisp/Scheme dialects):

Block comment example:

  #|
    Even semicolons can be here;
    &quot;Note that quoted strings need to be balanced&quot;
    #| We can also &quot;nest&quot; block comments |#
  |#

The above is quite similar to the way OCaml-comments work (e.g. wrt.
quoted strings).

Examples for S-expression comments (could also span across several
lines as e.g. with large, deeply nested lists):

  #; (this (nested list) will be ignored) (this (one) not)
  #; &quot;this quoted atom will be ignored&quot; &quot;this one not&quot;
  #; ignored-atom present-atom

I have also added a new Vim-syntax file to Sexplib, which will
highlight the above comment syntax and also flag incorrect constructs
(e.g. now illegal atoms).

The above improvements can theoretically break old S-expression files.
 I took some syntax design decisions that make this highly unlikely.
The new comment sequences (&quot;#|&quot;, &quot;|#&quot;, &quot;#;&quot;) by themselves should be
extremely unlikely in unquoted atoms in existing S-expression files.

In order to make the syntax work with little chance of breaking
anything, some forms of unquoted atoms are now illegal, e.g.:

  foo#|bar    bar|#foo    |#bla

The above, as pretty much any unquoted atom containing either &quot;#|&quot; or
&quot;|#&quot;, will raise parsing exceptions.  A &quot;#&quot; or &quot;|&quot; in an unquoted atom
without the offending second character is perfectly acceptable.

  #|bla

The above would introduce a comment and quite surely also raise a
parsing exception, since it is not very likely to be properly
balanced.  The sequence &quot;#;&quot; would only appear at a location where the
user already put a comment right after an unquoted single-character
hash.  This, again, is exceptionally unlikely, and even if it
occurred, it would very likely be flagged due to broken structure.

Old systems are able to read new files as long as the new-style
comments are not used, which should be the case for all automatically
printed (using Sexplib) S-expressions.  The only difference could be
some extra quotes around atoms, which is perfectly consistent with old
syntax.  If any unlikely conflicts arose with new systems due to badly
formatted old files, it should be trivial to rewrite these files
automatically to the new syntax.

Given that the syntax improvements are almost certainly going to work
well with the vast majority of existing systems and files, I'd
therefore suggest adopting them.  The productivity gains for human
editors of large S-expression files should be noticeable.

Regards,
Markus
