It's a fair concern, but I think that our internal development cycle is
going to be quite hard to change in this way.

As for users, it's worth noting that we'll all be users at home!  One of
the big drivers of the public release is to allow people to use Core and
Async for their own personal projects, so we'll have a set of internal
users almost immediately.

As for bugs and documentation, the public release will get the same code
and the same documentation that we get internally (for what that's worth;
the documentation could be better...).  And we'll cut major releases from
the point in history where we have completed a full code-review cycle, so
the quality should be good.

There's no doubt that we'll have to work hard to make sure that externally
developed patches are integrated reasonably.  And I think we'll have to
find a modus vivendi on that, in particular finding a set of external
people who we trust to propose changes before we spend serious time
evaluating those changes.


&gt;<i> Is there any reason not to split out your use of Core into a separate
</I>&gt;<i> repository which is suitable for public release, and consumed by your
</I>&gt;<i> internal systems?  We did this for Xen via Mercurial patchqueues (held in
</I>&gt;<i> a separate repository), to make it clear which the product-local changes
</I>&gt;<i> were.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree getting it out there is the most important thing.  That's why we

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet.  I think we're going to strip it clean and regenerate it in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; next few days to fix a few problems that showed up.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great! Will there be history in the regenerated one? I just see a mega

</I>

No regenerated history, I'm afraid, and that is not likely to change.
