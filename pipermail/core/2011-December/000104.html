Hi Ron,

As long as every sub-project (type-conv, sexplib, bin-prot, etc.) can
build and install completely separately, this should be fine.  The
sub-directories should ideally be identical to what's going into the
release tarballs.  That said, if there is a way to keep things in
separate repos, I'd prefer that solution.

On another note, any news on your commitment to Oasis?  I'm still
holding off on switching my other libraries as long as it's future is
unclear, which mostly depends on whether or not Jane Street will
support it.

Btw., do you have any intentions to release your OMakeroot?  I guess
it might be useful for people who prefer OMake over ocamlbuild.

Indeed, Stephen's golden fingerprints are all over the code ;-).  Nice job!

&gt;<i> We might blow this one away and recreate it on Monday, but I wanted to

Looks great, I can't wait to see a public release....

Regards,
Markus
