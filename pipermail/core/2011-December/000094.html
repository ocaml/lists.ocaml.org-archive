Hey Markus.  One thing I wanted to bounce off of you is how you feel
about the idea of us integrating the type-conv suite into the Core
repo.  We'd still release separate tarballs so people could download
just the bits they want.  But we were thinking it would be easier to
manage the coordination with our internal tree if we kept them
together in the repo.

We've basically given up on Git and Github, though Yury is going to
give it one more try.  We've done a preliminary export (the build
isn't set up quite right yet, but the code is all there) on bitbucket.

   <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core">https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core</A>

This is cut from trunk and has Stephen's new refactor of Async.  We'll
probably get this through code review in January or February.

We might blow this one away and recreate it on Monday, but I wanted to
give you an early look.
