</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey Markus.  One thing I wanted to bounce off of you is how you feel

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repo.  We'd still release separate tarballs so people could download
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just the bits they want.  But we were thinking it would be easier to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manage the coordination with our internal tree if we kept them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together in the repo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as every sub-project (type-conv, sexplib, bin-prot, etc.) can
</I>&gt;<i> build and install completely separately, this should be fine.  The
</I>&gt;<i> sub-directories should ideally be identical to what's going into the
</I>&gt;<i> release tarballs.  That said, if there is a way to keep things in
</I>&gt;<i> separate repos, I'd prefer that solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Making the sub-directories separately releasable is very much the intent,
and the single-repo approach is much easier for us to keep in sync with our
internal dev process.


&gt;<i> On another note, any news on your commitment to Oasis?  I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> holding off on switching my other libraries as long as it's future is
</I>&gt;<i> unclear, which mostly depends on whether or not Jane Street will

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No news yet, but we're looking at the question.  I think in the end OCaml
needs something along the lines of what oasis provides (i.e., a cabal
clone.)  The question in my mind is whether Oasis is the right tool to get
us there.


&gt;<i> Btw., do you have any intentions to release your OMakeroot?  I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it might be useful for people who prefer OMake over ocamlbuild.
</I>

I don't see why not.  Nick Chapman actually just completed a ground-up
rewrite of the rules that greatly simplifies the system and makes it more
efficient and less flaky --- the transdeps hack is now gone, for one thing,
and compilation of big trees is something like 30% faster.  And we also
have a better development mode where we turn off cross-module inlining and
therefore can avoid recompilations after a change that doesn't affect the
interface of a module.

So, I'll talk to Yury and Nick and see if we could include our OMakeroot
and OMakefiles.


&gt;<i> &gt; We've basically given up on Git and Github, though Yury is going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give it one more try.  We've done a preliminary export (the build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't set up quite right yet, but the code is all there) on bitbucket.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core">https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is cut from trunk and has Stephen's new refactor of Async.  We'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably get this through code review in January or February.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, Stephen's golden fingerprints are all over the code ;-).  Nice job!
</I>

I do like having that guy around.  Sometimes I think about what our
codebase would be like if we hadn't hired him and I shudder...


&gt;<i> &gt; We might blow this one away and recreate it on Monday, but I wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give you an early look.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks great, I can't wait to see a public release....
