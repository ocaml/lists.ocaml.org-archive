Subject: [omake] How to capture both stdout and return code of shell command?
Message-ID: <CADU9VHt9ZgNuK_8AzV417snKnHqbbVNKJ9d=m2-hSbHJ6wPaDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I?ve made good use of shell-code to execute commands and capture their
return code but now I?d like to capture their stdout (and stderr if
possible) as well, rather than have it dumped on the screen.

Is there a simple way to accomplish this? I?ve RTFM?d but could only think
of convoluted ways that involve file redirection. I?m probably missing
something simple.

Thanks,

Rudi.

There is nothing at hand. Just read a little bit through the source
code:

If you call $(shell) or $(shella), this goes straightly to
Omake_rule.eval_shell_output, which is calling eval_shell_exp. If the
exit code is not zero, an exception is raised. However, the exception is
just a generic one, and does not include the exit code in a way you can
use from omake code.

If you call $(shell-code) the exception from eval_shell_exp is
suppressed, and the code is returned.

Another observation is that eval_shell_output simply creates a temporary
file and saves the command output there. There seems to be no way to
directly read into a buffer.

So, I'd say the way to go (for the time being) is to create a temp file
and redirect into this while using $(shell-code) to run the whole thing.

Gerd

Thanks Gerd, I will do that for now. Creating a temporary file with omake?s tmpfile seems easy enough so I will do that.
