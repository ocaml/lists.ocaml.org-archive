Subject: [omake] Overriding OMakefile variables from the command line
Message-ID: <a35cb87a-6b0c-b74b-9e03-08797757f8c9@taranjali.org>

I am working on a GPL open source research project RefPerSys 
(https://gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys) that uses OMake. OMake's 
dependency analysis using MD5 digests is essential for our project.

In our OMakefile, we have an `OPTIMFLAGS` variable that specifies the 
default GCC optimisation flags. The behaviour that we are looking for is 
to override the `OPTIMFLAGS` variable from the command line, in a manner 
similar to Makefiles.

What we have observed is that OMake seems to ignore the `OPTIMFLAGS` 
variable passed through the command line when it is already specified in 
the OMakefile.

In our OMakefile 
(https://gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys/blob/master/OMakefile), line 63, 
we have `|OPTIMFLAGS = -O0 -g3`. However, when we run `omake clean` 
followed by `||omake "OPTIMFLAGS='-O0 -fno-inline -DONTWANTOPTIMS -g3'" 
--verbose, we note that `OPTIMFLAGS` is still set as `-O0 -g3` and not 
`O0 -fno-inline -DONTWANTOPTIMS -g3` as anticipated.
|

Is this the expected behaviour? And if so, is there a way to achieve 
what we have in mind, i.e., overriding OMakefile variables through the 
command line?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Abhishek Chakravarti
