Subject: [omake] Is there a way to 'export' variable value from
	sub-OMakefile to parent?
Message-ID: <CABgqFzCRFGniU6TCwgLR3Yr-rWGu9zMs0Ozw8vZR1WPH4=r-Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had a general question. Please help if someone had answer. (Also
advise if I should ask this question in other place.)

Is there any way to 'export' variable value from sub-OMakefile to
parent? Sometimes I want to declare 'accumulator' variable in root
OMakefile and append to it in sub-OMakefiles using += operator, and
then do some task with accumulated values in root OMakefile. For
example, accumulate paths of all .o files in sub-directories and link
them into single .exe file in the root directory.

It seems to me that, it is not possible. (Exceptionally, when
sub-OMakefile is written as .SUBDIRS section in root OMakefile,
'export' command works for this purpose.) Passing information from
sub-OMakefile to parent is only possible via target file in sub
directory and dependency to it from root OMakefile. For above example
case, I have to link .o files into .a file in sub-OMakefile and
declare dependency from .exe to that .a file in root OMakefile. Is
this correct understanding?

Regards,
Nozomi Shibano

Right, normal .SUBDIRS (w/o section) always starts a new environment,
and there is no way to export updated variables.

Based on this observation, here is an idea: maybe the combo .SUBDIRS
section with "include" works:

.SUBDIRS: dir
    include OMakefile
    export variable

This is not tested, though.

Note that a simple "include dir/OMakefile" would not work because the
rules in OMakefile wouldn't then be applied to the subdirectory.

Hi Gerd,

Thank you for your kind answer.

I have done some test with your idea and it works. Here is short
summary of test:

'export' in sub-OMakefile => doesn't work
'export' in included sub-OMakefile => works
.SUBDIR with 'export region'  => works

Test files are uploaded here:
