Message-ID: <1475446714.21378.13.camel@gerd-stolpmann.de>

Hi,

I'm happy to announce a new test release of omake. This is a candidate
for a regular release, and if no new serious bugs are found, the
regular release will likely happen in the course of October.

Since omake-0.10.0-test2, a couple of bugs were fixed:
?- private variables in foreach loops work now as expected
?- fixed "rm -rf" so that it never follows symlinks
? ?(2nd attempt of a fix)
?- The "equal" function works also for arrays. This fixes
? ?a couple of unit tests using this feature.

Of course, all the nice work of the previous test releases is also
available, in particular the speedup for large projects, and the new
bootstrap system.

The tarball can be downloaded at
http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html. The repository is now
at Github, https://github.com/gerdstolpmann/omake. There is also an
issue tracker.

omake requires now ocaml-4.02 as minimum.

Hi,

it is my pleasure to announce the another release of omake which is the
first one for six years. It mainly includes performance improvements
for large projects, and a number of bug fixes:

?- omake got faster for large projects (this part of the work was
???funded by Lexifi)
?- there is a new bootstrap system that unifies Unix and Windows
?- it now also works with the MinGW port
?- private variables in foreach loops work now as expected
?- fixed "rm -rf" so that it never follows symlinks
???(2nd attempt of a fix)
?- The "equal" function works also for arrays. This fixes
???a couple of unit tests using this feature.

The new homepage is now http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html.?
See there for all the other links.

The old homepage omake.metaprl.org is no longer updated (I don't have 
access, and don't know how to take it down).
