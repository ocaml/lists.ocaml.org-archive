Hi,

there is a new test release of omake. It includes all the developments
since I started taking omake over last year, in particular:

 - omake got faster for large projects (this part of the work was
   funded by Lexifi)
 - there is a new bootstrap system that unifies Unix and Windows
 - it now also works with the MinGW port
 - a couple of bugs were fixed

This is a test release. In particular, it would be good to know whether
the new bootstrap works everywhere, and whether I package omake up
correctly.

The tarball can be downloaded at
http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/omake.html. The repository is now
at Github, https://github.com/gerdstolpmann/omake. There is also an
issue tracker.

omake requires now ocaml-4.02 as minimum.

Gerd
