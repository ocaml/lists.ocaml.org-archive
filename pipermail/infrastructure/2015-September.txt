Subject: [ocaml-infra] new mailing list for ocaml-containers
Message-ID: <20150909131922.GN24352@carty.inria.fr>

Hello,

There are problems with ocamlforge's mailing lists (due to spam), where
I just created a mailing list for my project
https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers . I was made aware that
ocaml.org hosted mailing lists, and I would like to create one for
containers users, if it is possible? 

The name would be 'containers-users' and the admin myself (at least for
a start).

Best,

Dear all,

This is just a reminder that this process is still ongoing.  

The following people are currently involved with the domain itself or Projects that make use of it.  For each of the people in the list, do you agree to adopt the governance document?

- Ashish Agarwal
- Amir Chaudhry
- Thomas Gazagnaire
- Louis Gesbert
- Sylvain Le Gall
- Thomas Leonard
- Xavier Leroy
- Anil Madhavapeddy
- David Sheets
- Christophe Troestler
- Philippe Wang

I've made an issue on the www.ocaml.org repository [1] to track the responses. A reminder of where we are in the process is below.

-- The process for adopting the governance framework --

0. I draft and discuss a governance document with existing project maintainers and reach agreement. (DONE).
1.  I send an email update to the infra list and caml-list, with a link to a public version of the doc. (DONE)
2.  We allow a period of public discussion on the infra list. (IN PROGRESS)
3.  During this, I explicitly ask Maintainers and Owner to confirm they will adopt the doc. (IN PROGRESS)
4.  In parallel, I create an issue on the ocaml.org repo with a list of people to check off as agreements come in -- important that the responses happen on the mailing list as that's properly archived. (IN PROGRESS)
5.  Once all the affirmations are in, I push the doc to the ocaml.org site.

Best wishes,
Amir

Hi Amir,

  It seems a bit surprising for me, while reading the document, that
only people are involved, and not organizations. Given the structure
of the OCaml community, I would have expected INRIA, Jane Street,
OCamlPro, OCamllabs to be explicitely part of the discussion. For
example, opam.ocaml.org is maintained by OCamlPro (for OPAM source
itself, by formerly Thomas and now Louis) and OCamllabs (for the
repository, by Anil and Thomas). So, can a "Maintainer" be a company
or institution, in addition to the  developers that are currently
doing the work ? Moreover, the name "OCaml" still belongs to INRIA, so
I would have expected to see Xavier mentionned as both the main
Owner/Maintainer of OCaml, and as representing INRIA and the Caml
Consortium for all OCaml business.

Best regards,
--Fabrice

I agree to adopt it.  And I thank Amir for all his efforts setting it up.

I read this as a board of trustees: people who might represent
organizations, but also contribute personally to the operation of the
ocaml.org infrastructure, and commit to support it in their personal
names.  Inria, OCamlPro, and OCamlLabs are represented.  I guess
someone from Jane Street would be welcome if he/she participates in
the operation.

No opinion.

> Moreover, the name "OCaml" still belongs to INRIA

Technically, no:  Inria doesn't have a trademark on "OCaml" nor "Caml"
(believe it or not, that was considered in the late 80's, but
abandoned), and I *personally* own the ocaml.org domain.

I will gladly play that role of representative when needed, but I'm
not sure it shoudl be written in the document.

Best,

I also agree to adopting this governance document.

That's exactly the model that would be most beneficial. The infrastructure
around the operations is fairly non-trivial now (>10 VMs), and so requires
a certain amount of trust in the *individuals* taking part to not abuse
it.  Naming people explicitly ensures that if they depart or otherwise
wish to transition away, the remaining group can ensure that the health
of the deployment.

I'd be against a company being the maintainer.  Both Thomas and Louis
(and me, and David Sheets, etc...) have quite a bit of unwritten knowledge
about the current deployment, and I trust them to handle it all correctly
until we get around to documenting everything perfectly.  If people just
start swapping around and giving each other SSH root keys to VMs, things
will rapidly descend into chaos.

Consider how many companies have come and gone in OCaml's 20 year history.
The same individual characters still pop up with alarming regularity
through those years, however, no matter who the paymasters are :-)

Please do also note that OCaml Labs is nothing like OCamlPro, and cannot
identify as a corporate entity. It's a group within the Cambridge Computer
Laboratory, and not separately incorporated.  As such, we are covered by
the Statutes of the University of Cambridge Regent House, which includes
the assignment of non-patentable intellectual property (such as copyright)
with the individual members.  Therefore, anyone who contributes from this
group acts as an individual, despite being part of an academic collective.

The same is true of the GitHub organisation, and the VMs are "personally"
owned by me via the Rackspace Developer Program.  I would be happy to
assign some sort of co-ownership to Xavier in the future to ensure that
he has full access to every part of the infrastructure.

I have exactly the opposite opinion: companies have been quite
consistent in their choice of OCaml (with good reasons ;-) ), and once
they had a good part of their software in OCaml, it's hard for them to
stop supporting it. The membership of the Caml Consortium has been
also very constant over the years, increasing slowly but keeping most
former members.  When Thomas left OCamlPro, it was also the fact that
we already had started to distribute his knowledge of OPAM that
allowed us to go on in the developement without almost any disruption
(and today, we already have other developers ready to take over the
development if Louis gets bored). On the contrary, individuals are
much more versatile, they can contribute full-time to OCaml (if their
employer allows them), or only part-time (on spare time), or not at
all (if they get interested in a project that uses OCaml, but do not
contribute to it) depending on many different constraints, that
ocaml.org should depend on.

Anyway, I am still puzzled by this document, I would have expected a
dedicated organization (an "association" in French law) to take over
this task, as it is the case for some other open-source languages
(Python for example). What is the legal meaning of signing this
document ? In an association, the governance dictates who governs the
association, what they can do (i.e. what they are allowed to do, and
what they are not allowed to do), who votes for them, how to become a
member, etc. And if you don't follow the association rules, you are
excluded. Here, I don't see any such thing.

Let's take some examples of things that could also be clarified: if
somebody wants a new project to become an ocaml.org project, how long
is he supposed to wait to get a reply ? When is the "consensus phase"
supposed to end, if nobody replies with either yes or no ?  Is it yes
by default, or no by default ? What if nobody is against the project,
but still the sub-domain name is not created ? on the contrary,
suppose that there is no consensus for a project, but somebody with
admin rights decides to still create the sub-domain, is it ok ?

For me, such a document should handle all these cases, and the process
should be democratic (admin rights should be put to a vote by the
members). Which leads to having an association for that. And
associations usually welcome institutions too, not only individuals,
even if they give them different rights.

Finally, the compiler/distribution is now distributed on ocaml.org,
since caml.inria.fr is deprecated. But is it an ocaml.org project ?
What rights have the core-team members over the corresponding pages ?
Shall they care about changing them in the event of the migration of
sources from SVN to GIT, or is it a task for the ocaml.org project
itself ?

My two(four?) cents,
--Fabrice
PS: and I am also thankful to Amir for starting this work and this
(important) discussion.

My point is not that companies backing OCaml aren't valuable, but that
the individuals themselves should commit to the 'board of trustees'
(as Xavier put it).  For instance, my observation is that the real
handoff of OPAM happened after Thomas left OCamlPro, over the course
of a year.  This was primarily a 1:1 between him and Louis via the
usual code mentoring, and happened as a personal undertaking.

There is no legal meaning to signing this document, because nobody is
signing anything.  It is, as Amir noted, a "living document" that
simply documents what superstructure exists at the moment.  As Xavier
notes, many of the resources currently used by ocaml.org are owned
personally by several of us, and we are keen to 1) ensure that their
ownership is tracked; and 2) a path of authority exists to one person
(Xavier Leroy) to facilitate any conflict resolution.

There may be an OCaml Foundation in the future, but there have been
no concrete movements in this direction yet beyond this effort to 
document what currently exists.

We will need to clarify all of these things together, moving forward.
For now, the important scope from my perspective is simply to document
what we have an ensure that the community knows what is available
(e.g. the mailing lists), and to enable people who are interested in
helping to step up.  For instance, if someone wanted to help manage the
mailing list infrastructure other than me, I'd be quite happy to
document it better and grant access.  The only area where I really
need to keep control is the Rackspace VM infrastructure, since it
puts around $25,000 a year onto my personal credit card before being
reimbursed...

I'm sure we will all come up with a nice democratic system in a few
years when our community grows so large that we need to elect local
governors of the subdomains.  For now though, this seems like a poor
reason to refrain from documenting the status quo that already exists.

Xavier and Damien have administrative access to any ocaml.org needed
already.

I'm also trying to understand if there's something you need that you
can't currently do with the ocaml.org infrastructure... happy to help
as I can if so.

Dear Simon,

This has now been setup, with the default settings for lists.ocaml.org
(including moderation of non-list members by default)

You should have been mailed an admin password, and can access the panel
at:  http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/containers-users/general

If you need additional admins, you can add them there yourself.

cheers,
Anil

an aspect of the ocaml.org website -- called the "WWW project" in the

Should we consider that updating the relevant ocaml.org pages is part of
the release process?

This isn't done currently. In fact:
- ocaml.org has no mention of the new OCaml releases anywhere
- the Install page is out of date with respect to OCaml versions (it says
`opam switch 4.02.1` instead of `opam switch 4.02.3`).

On the last couple releases I have helped (as part of my Changelog-patting
process) Damien and Xavier come up with a short summary of the changes, to
craft an announce on caml.inria.fr. Should we do this for ocaml.org now?

One subtlety is that some updates only make sense after the corresponding
OPAM switch has been made available in the official repository. There is no
formalized synchronization between the release announcment and a switch,
but in practice a switch is released on the day of the release, and for
4.02.2 and 4.02.3 it was prepared by Damien directly (and merged in a few
hours by the opam-repository maintainers).

We could send a pull request for the website at the same time as the
compiler description, and wait for its integration to announce the release.

I agree to adopt this governance document. Apologies for my delayed reply,
and thanks to Amir for all the hard work on this.

I partially agree with Fabrice that organizations could be taken into
account, but think the "named" maintainers should be individuals. As Anil
states, it is important to know which individuals specifically have the
rights discussed in this document. I wouldn't be very comfortable knowing
only that "someone" at Jane Street or OCaml Labs or wherever is the one
making decisions. A simple compromise could be to list an individual's
affiliation, e.g.

- Louis Gesbert (OCamlPro)

This would indicate that Louis's involvement is on behalf of OCamlPro, if
that's indeed how he views is involvement.


> Finally, the compiler/distribution is now distributed on ocaml.org, since
caml.inria.fr is deprecated. But is it an ocaml.org project ?

No. There is a variety of content hosted on ocaml.org that is not part of
the "ocaml.org project". It is just the hosting of the content, not the
content itself, that is part of the project. For example, we host slides
from the OCaml meeting but the license clearly indicates that copyright is
maintained by the contributing author.

> What rights have the core-team members over the corresponding pages ?
Shall they care about changing them in the event of the migration of
sources from SVN to GIT, or is it a task for the ocaml.org project itself ?

They have the right suggest changes or submit a pull request for desired
changes (just like anyone in the world). The ocaml.org project admins are
obligated to consider their request and accept if it is in the best
interest of the community. Your example would obviously qualify.

Hope that helps clarify some of the points.

Hi,

I agree to adopting this governance document.

Right.  I made this joke to Anil already, but let me repeat it because
I'm easily amused:

Some people were expecting this document to be a constitution, of the
continental Europe and American kind.  Instead, it's more like the
British state:  there is an emphasis on time-honored best practices,
fair discussions, jurisprudence; Anil as the current prime minister;
and I as the benevolent but almighty Queen.

As shocking as it is to people raised in Napoleonic law, the British
state works.  Why wouldn't this document work too?

Wow.  I hope this is one of those credit cards where you get frequent
flyer miles or other loyalty points :-)

Do you think this is sustainable in the long term?  And do you have an
idea of how much CPU power and storage space this represents?  (Just
curious.)

Yes please. It is wrong that the current release announcements still refer
to caml.inria.fr, and it is an unnecessary duplication of work to then
create the corresponding ocaml.org pages.


This isn't done currently. In fact:

The releases are listed here [1], and I see now that we have some bugs [2].
Sorry about that. I usually take care of the ocaml.org release pages but
failed to do so for 4.02.3.

[1] http://ocaml.org/releases/
[2] https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/698

IMHO we should stop updating caml.inria.fr completely. Continuing to use it
only causes confusion. At most, maybe some caml.inria.fr pages should
redirect to the corresponding ocaml.org pages.

Sorry, I didn't know about http://ocaml.org/releases/ . How is this page
reached from the homepage?

My understanding of the front page architecture is that the "News" panel is
actually the RSS feed of the OCaml planet. That means that the best way to
give the release some visibility on the webpage at release time would be to
publish a blog post in a blog aggregated by the planet. I will be happy to
use Gagallium for this purpose for now.

The existence of this page is indeed not evident. It is linked to from the
Install page, but even there the link is buried within text. I think we can
replace the footer link "Compiler Sources" with "Releases". The Releases
page already links to the compiler source code so this would be more
comprehensive. I'll do this soon.

Yes.

That would be great. We can also make some news items "sticky", so they
stay at the top. You can see this currently for OCaml 2015 and OCaml Online
Course. Note the icon for them is different.

Dear all,

All of the acceptances have been received and I've been keeping track of them in the related GitHub issue [1], with links back to the mailing list archive.

Since we've now completed this round of work, I've submitted a pull request to the ocaml.org website [2], which should place the document at http://ocaml.org/governance.html.  I've folded the information on current active projects into the existing wiki page where we keep track of our resources [3].

As mentioned before, this is intended to be a living document and represents where we are now.  As the community continues to grow and evolve, we should revisit this to ensure it is accurate and is meeting our needs.

Many thanks, everyone!

I'd hope that we'd end up with more of a Corbyn than a Cameron :-)

Rackspace have been really generous with their cloud allotment, but
if it disappears then we can easily compress back down to a few physical
VMs.  Right now, the breakdown of VMs is roughly:

- infrastructure for DNS, HTTP(s) sites
- two large ones for Sylvain to migrate Forge onto
- some developer VMs (e.g. a FreeBSD one)
- remainder are CISO build VMs running as workers

The latter is where the bulk of the VM load lies -- I think we run
around 100 CPUs in total for parallel builds, and we can easily
accommodate more.  I think the whole of OPAM could be built in about
30 minutes with sufficient VMs, since Coq is probably the longest
build time in there at the moment for an individual package...

Logs are currently hovering at about 500GB uncompressed, but Thomas
Leonard put those into Irmin and they trivially compressed down to
a tenth of that once stored in Git.

Corbyn is a firm anti-monarchist so I guess that will make for an interesting relationship :)

Thanks for the discussion everyone.  I decided to put my thoughts into a blog post, which summarises the discussions I?ve been having (some of the points have come up several times).
