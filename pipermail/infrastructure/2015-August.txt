Subject: [ocaml-infra] Machine/VM to temporarily run some stats on OPAM repo
Message-ID: <BBBF425A-16AF-4C37-88BE-8ED1E2226673@cam.ac.uk>

Hi folks,

I?m working with Christophe on generating some rough data about all the packages that are part of opam repo.  To do this, we?ll need to (bare) clone all the repos themselves and then run some tools over them.

Given the number of repos and the time it might take (possibly a few hours per run), I think it would be unwise to do this on our laptops.  I?m wondering if there?s a machine or VM available where we can run this.

Anil, d?you know of anything we can use for this?  It doesn?t have to be up long term as it?s just to allow us to experiment.

Amir

Hi Amir,

Setting up a VM on Rackspace is fine for this -- I've provisioned one with enough storage for cloning all the repositories and  sent the login details onto Christophe directly. It's fairly expensive to have this running for a long period -- will you need it for more than a month?

Once the scripts themselves are packaged up in OPAM, I can increase the size of the opam.ocaml.org VM to increase its storage volumes to a large enough size to handle the stats generation as well.

cheers,
Anil

Thanks! I doubt we'll need it that long as I'll be happy if we can get one run with decent output (might take a few iterations to get there).

Sounds good. 

Best wishes,

Great -- please let me know when it can be decommissioned then.  There's no immediate rush.

I don't know exactly what data you're gathering, but the `couverture.ml` script in opam.git/admin-scripts can be used to try and get all packages installed in a few iterations.

Just in case it might come in handy!
The script only follows solver constraints and returns a list of lists of packages.

Subject: [ocaml-infra] Adopting a Governance framework for OCaml.org
Message-ID: <A6EC58B0-4D10-4572-9FC7-26186DE58BEF@cam.ac.uk>

Dear all,

Earlier this year, I began working towards a governance framework for the OCaml.org domain and the projects that make use of it. I wrote about my approach to this and mentioned that such a framework should:
 - demonstrate a commitment to a stable decision-making process.
 - be clear about scope (i.e. OCaml.org).
 - document current reality, rather than being aspirational.
 - be a living document, meaning that it can and should evolve.

Please read the original post for detail on the above points.
http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg/

Since that time, I've drafted a governance document and discussed it with those who already run projects under OCaml.org.  We've reached a point where we're ready to discuss this more widely and more formally adopt the model.

Starting from today, we're sharing the document publicly and inviting any discussion on this mailing list (infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org).  During this time, I'll also be asking the existing maintainers to ratify the document.

By the 14th of September we'll wrap things up (for this time around) and publish version 1.0 of the agreed document on OCaml.org

You can find a draft linked below and the step-by-step process we're following.  Please do share your thoughts on this thread.

Document: https://gist.github.com/amirmc/fe8a931c246bb13d9b32

-- The process for adopting the governance framework --

0. I draft and discuss a governance document with existing project maintainers and reach agreement. (DONE).
1.  I send an email update to the infra list and caml-list, with a link to a public version of the doc.
2.  We allow a period of public discussion on the infra list.
3.  During this, I explicitly ask Maintainers and Owner to confirm they will adopt the doc.
4.  In parallel, I create an issue on the ocaml.org repo with a list of people to check off as agreements come in -- important that the responses happen on the mailing list as that's properly archived.
5.  Once all the affirmations are in, I push the doc to the ocaml.org site.

Best wishes,
Amir
