I think OCaml Labs is doing something about it, although it will be
super nice to have some reporting interfaces to display results of
build done anywhere.

E.g. I have a jenkins instance with slaves on 3 arches (RPi,
Linux/i386, Linux/amd64, with Win7, Mac OS X and FreeBSD installed but
not yet setup). I would like to have a common piece of infrastructure
to upload the JUnit XML output + set the build status to GREEN when it
succeeds  on one of my worker. I compile against HEAD of my VCS but
using OPAM (well GODI for now, but I plan to migrate). This can be as
simple as a FTP server where you need to put a bunch of HTML files but
that will be a central place to gather build data.

There is; see my recent write up on its status here:
http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/09/ocamlot-autotriaging.html

We're working on making the results more easily accessible via
permalinking and archiving, but for now the results are triaged
by me in OPAM bugs such as:
https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/1029

Fixes to any of those most welcome!

As I have some packages in OPAM (vector3, dolog),
I would like to receive an automatic e-mail if one of my packages is 
broken on some arch.

Since we're using GitHub in the workflow and plan to update the pull request thread with OCamlot comments, anyone involved in (or watching) the PR thread would automatically receive updates via GitHub. We need stable links for this to work properly. 

You can get an idea of the workflow via the screen cast I made earlier this year:

Can't a lot of this be done with TravisCI?  I have not used it but I'm
under the impression it allows you to run whatever you want across many
virtualized environments.

[CCing opam-devel]

It would certainly make sense to do some of it with TravisCI, but it hits
its limits fairly quickly (non-Linux, non-x86, constraint exploration).

I've been meaning to try Mike Lin's Travis/OPAM integration for ages, so
if you get a chance to refresh his script with OPAM 1.0/trunk and give
it a shot, I'd love to use it myself.

http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html

(more testing always better, as long as someone can triage it, and Travis
is very convenient to use indeed!)

+1 if someone can spend time on this. I'll add a .travis.yml to my
github project if it is possible (even though I have a running
Jenkins).

All this builder (Travis/Jenkins/ocamlot) are good to test a project
in non upstream developper environment and helps to catch obvious
error that will happen the first time someone else than the mani
developper try to build an OCaml project.

If you need tester, I am all for it.

Dear all,

I've just put up a blog post asking for feedback on the ocaml.org redesign [1].  I'm specifically interested in getting feedback on (1) the second iteration of the OCaml Logo and (2) the new design for ocaml.org.  See the blog post for more information.  We're tracking feedback via issues [2] and there are some known issues already listed there.

Thanks,
Amir

Is the process opened ?
I mean is it possible for external people to also make submissions/proposals?

(I don't know who made this proposal, but I guess he/she/they would
maybe not be happy if someone else also make submissions/proposal. And
graphics-design world is very unfair when several people work and only
one wins.)

Also usually graphics-designers make several design proposals. Could
it be possible to see the other ones and comment these?

If concurrent submissions/proposals are not allowed, is it allowed to
modify this one?
