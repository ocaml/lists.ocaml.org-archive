I'd hope that we'd end up with more of a Corbyn than a Cameron :-)

Rackspace have been really generous with their cloud allotment, but
if it disappears then we can easily compress back down to a few physical
VMs.  Right now, the breakdown of VMs is roughly:

- infrastructure for DNS, HTTP(s) sites
- two large ones for Sylvain to migrate Forge onto
- some developer VMs (e.g. a FreeBSD one)
- remainder are CISO build VMs running as workers

The latter is where the bulk of the VM load lies -- I think we run
around 100 CPUs in total for parallel builds, and we can easily
accommodate more.  I think the whole of OPAM could be built in about
30 minutes with sufficient VMs, since Coq is probably the longest
build time in there at the moment for an individual package...

Logs are currently hovering at about 500GB uncompressed, but Thomas
Leonard put those into Irmin and they trivially compressed down to
a tenth of that once stored in Git.
