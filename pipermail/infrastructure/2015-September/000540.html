<PRE>Dear all,

All of the acceptances have been received and I've been keeping track of them in the related GitHub issue [1], with links back to the mailing list archive.

Since we've now completed this round of work, I've submitted a pull request to the ocaml.org website [2], which should place the document at <A HREF="http://ocaml.org/governance.html.">http://ocaml.org/governance.html.</A>  I've folded the information on current active projects into the existing wiki page where we keep track of our resources [3].

As mentioned before, this is intended to be a living document and represents where we are now.  As the community continues to grow and evolve, we should revisit this to ensure it is accurate and is meeting our needs.

Many thanks, everyone!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Earlier this year, I began working towards a governance framework for the OCaml.org domain and the projects that make use of it. I wrote about my approach to this and mentioned that such a framework should:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - demonstrate a commitment to a stable decision-making process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - be clear about scope (i.e. OCaml.org).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - document current reality, rather than being aspirational.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - be a living document, meaning that it can and should evolve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please read the original post for detail on the above points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg/">http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since that time, I've drafted a governance document and discussed it with those who already run projects under OCaml.org.  We've reached a point where we're ready to discuss this more widely and more formally adopt the model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Starting from today, we're sharing the document publicly and inviting any discussion on this mailing list (<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org</A>).  During this time, I'll also be asking the existing maintainers to ratify the document.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the 14th of September we'll wrap things up (for this time around) and publish version 1.0 of the agreed document on OCaml.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can find a draft linked below and the step-by-step process we're following.  Please do share your thoughts on this thread.
