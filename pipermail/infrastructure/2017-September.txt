I am therefore preparing to document and release the Docker container images and scripts to build them regularly off the ocaml.org infrastructure. The image repositories consist of:

There are probably some minor adaptions we'd need to make, as for a few of our repos the tests involve building RPMs, but this is mainly for our daemons. The more generic libraries we're working on should be testable just using opam, and a larger set of distros/ocaml versions to test with would be quite reassuring.

Just an update on this -- I haven't forgotten about the repository move, but I decided not to promote the images in their current form to an "official" set of repositories.

The reason is that we can dramatically shrink the size of the container images by using multi-stage builds in Docker to avoid having two copies of the OCaml toolchain in each compiler.  I would also like to add multiarch support so that arm32/64/x86_32/x64_64/ppc64be are all in place.

We are currently in discussions with Packet.net who has kindly been sponsoring us with arm hosted machines for this purpose, so I hope to have it all in place before Christmas, at which point we can publish official OCaml container images that are both portable and just the right size for long-term deployments!

regards,
Anil
