Agreed.  I did not say that there should not be any other website
about OCaml (there are other ones actually and we are not trying to
merge them), my point is that a language needs a central point of
visibility (and there is no argument that it is <A HREF="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</A>
for Python, <A HREF="http://www.haskell.org/">http://www.haskell.org/</A> for Haskell,...).  In your
example, <A HREF="http://www.afpy.org/">http://www.afpy.org/</A> is not trying to be a substitute to
python.org, or a French translation of it, it provides different
services tailored to the French community.

&gt;<i> Also, you cannot say: everybody who wants to build a website for OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> should join this team. It is an utopia. Life is not like that. [...]
</I>
Sorry if I was unclear but I did not mean that &quot;everybody who wants to
build a website for OCaml should join this team&quot;.  What I meant is
that if somebody wants to build a website that provides the same
services as ocaml.org (for example a translation of it), they would be
well advised to get in touch and see whether they can contribute to
ocaml.org directly.  Providing the same services on a different site
will result in a loss for both parties IMHO.  (Of course, everybody is
free to do what they want, we are lucky enough to live in free countries.)

Hope I was clearer.

Best,
C.
