Subject: [ocaml-infra] Request to start a gitter.im room for
 github:ocaml/ocaml and a bridge to IRC

After surveying the opinions of people on IRC and discussions of
advancing the community's interests on a mailing list thread ('How to
encourage the adoption of OCaml'), I'd like to propose opening a room
on gitter.im for the ocaml/ocaml repository (gitter rooms exist on a
per-repository basis).

An example gitter room can be viewed here: https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim

In general, I believe having real-time chat with persistent history
and notifications is extremely valuable. It is especially valuable for
beginners or people inquiring about OCaml, who are afraid to compose a
mailing list post. It is also valuable to developers of all sorts who
need full-duplex high-frequency minimally-formal communication, which
is often hampered by email.

Gitter chat is readily available to newcomers, unlike IRC. Even the
best current IRC viewer
(https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#freenode_#ocaml:matrix.org) still
requires steps to connect and lacks some of gitter's features. Gitter
rooms are read-only before logging in (which is still of value), and
read-write once you use a github login,  which just about every dev
has nowadays. Additionally, gitter allows for easy integration with
github issues, comments etc as can be seen in the example above.

The trickier part is connecting gitter to IRC. We want to do this both
to preserve history on our own terms - scraper tools exist for gitter
but it's nicer to preserve our own history using existing methods -
and to prevent fracturing of the community. The neovim project
linked-to above does this using a gitter-IRC bridge, which must be run
on a community server.

This means that to establish the gitter room + bridge we need to:
1. Create the gitter room on the gitter site. This must be done by
someone with OCaml github credentials by going to the gitter.im page
and choosing to create a room.
2. Follow the instructions at
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter using an OCaml
community server. The bridge must have access to github credentials as
well.
3. For maximum exposure, it would be nice to add the new room to the
ocaml.org community page.

Note that gitter rooms already exists for ocaml/oasis and ocaml/opam.
These are obviously project-specific and have use by themselves. I
envision ocaml/ocaml being used for the compiler as well as for the
language as a whole. It's worth thinking about the idea of creating an
ocaml/ocaml_beginners repo just for the sake of opening a gitter room
for beginners, similar to the way we have a (non-working)
ocaml_beginners list. Additionally, it would be a good idea to open a
gitter room for ocamlbuild.

Note: I asked to the #neovim folks about their experience, and they pointed
out that we wouldn't need to setup our own bridge server, as described in
the documentation that Yotam linked to, as they would be happy to add our
potential gitter/irc pair to their own bidirectional replication server.

(This discussion happened over IRC but you can have a look at the gitter
logs for it:
  https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim?at=5783e51cb79455146f9664e5
)

I'm personally not very enthusiastic about gitter itself, but in presence
of a bidirectional bridge I see no reason to not give it a try, so I would
support the experiment -- it could start with an explicit time limit at
which to reconsider the move, as we did for Github pull requests.

Hi,

How are op and moderation features handled? How are the gitter users
differentiated? Who has such rights on the gitter room?

Just to be clear: the lack of need for moderation of #ocaml is
exceptionally rare and such changes can impact the current balance at
least at first so I want to make sure we won't have to discover the
procedures in an emergency.

My understanding is that the bridge logs one IRC user per gitter user (the
nick is derived from the github username, so it's longer than usual IRC
nicknames), but has a single gitter user/bot that says "<user> on Freenode:
<message>", as you can see in the logs.

I would thus guess that moderation may need cooperation from both sides --
a troll on IRC needs to be silenced on IRC, and a troll on gitter to use
gitter's moderation feature, whatever they are. If this turned to be a
problem, we could cut the bridge.

I would definitely consider a requirement that someone volunteers to
perform gitter-side administration and moderation duties.

I'd be happy to set up a small VM or container for the purposes of the bridge.  From an infrastructure perspective, I just need a reliable point of contact in case of abuse, and some assurance that the service will be moderated reasonably.

I'd prefer not to share other projects' servers if possible, as this leads to a tangled mess quite quickly (especially in this day and age when webhooks are all the rage and establish dependencies quite fast).

Something that just occurred to me is that trolling on the gitter side
is unlikely. This is because to participate in the conversation, one
needs to log in using a github account, and trolls would be
potentially ruining their github reputation (which relies on stars and
such). This is unlike IRC trolls, who can connect anonymously and
switch nicknames ad nauseum.

Regardless, I'd be willing to monitor the gitter room if that is ok
with the infrastructure team. Since I am disconnected from the
Internet some of the time though, having another moderator would be a
good idea.
