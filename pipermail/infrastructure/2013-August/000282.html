</I>

Amir's approach is one of pipelining instead of serialising the design process.  Exposing the design early lets us find initial &quot;oh no!&quot; portions that must be corrected immediately. For instance, it's apparent that the logo font has no real fans, and we should get some more designs commissioned to explore alternative sooner rather than later.

While there have been comments on the rest of the design, there have been no real strong objections about the overall layout, so proceeding to the next phase when the content gets filled in makes sense.

Filling in the lorem ipsum is something that obviously needs to happen, and some real work has (is) happening to fill in the blanks there, at which point it'll be easier to refine the design more.  Let's treat this as an iterative process and not get bogged down in side debates about design philosophy while that happens...
