<PRE>This is great. I'm excited about the new design! Few comments:

* Should the categories Learn, Platform, etc. have their links right on the
front page? It is one extra click if you first have to click Learn, and
then get to a landing page, and then click something else. On the other
hand, the current design is cleaner.

* On my mobile phone, the drop down menus currently get converted to an
easy to scroll menu/sub-menu list. It seems to work quite well, so I don't
see the problem. Having the drop down menus would resolve the above point.
You get both a clean design and quick access to sub-menu items.

* The new design is less space efficient than the current one. The fonts
are bigger and there is more whitespace. Is that good? I tend to like
seeing more content in a given amount of screen space.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Feedback on the design would be most useful, as we can do a few
</I>&gt;<i> iterations with the company that did the HTML/CSS/logo work and make sure
</I>&gt;<i> we're all happy with the final result.  Personally, I love the new front
</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe one can discuss first the front page.  Here are a few questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Where should all the links of the current page go?  On sub-pages or
</I>&gt;<i> may some of them (which ones) appear below &quot;Learn&quot;,...?  If we move them to
</I>&gt;<i> separate pages, what text must be put on the side of the four boxes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be helpful to play with the interactive wireframe demo (link
</I>&gt;<i> below) to see how content is laid out.  In order to make the site easier to
</I>&gt;<i> navigate, there'll be additional 'landing pages', which is where the new
</I>&gt;<i> headings will point to.  The links (and content) will be put on those
</I>&gt;<i> pages.  The text on the side of the images will be descriptive.  See
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://git-scm.com">http://git-scm.com</A> for an example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, the aim of the front page is to be a lot cleaner and make it
</I>&gt;<i> easier for people to figure out what content they're after and demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> that the OCaml community is an active one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> demo:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://ocaml.mybalsamiq.com/projects/public-demo/naked/0_home?key=b897ea86d8a8199c6e46b3295ddf630dfa33e5e1">https://ocaml.mybalsamiq.com/projects/public-demo/naked/0_home?key=b897ea86d8a8199c6e46b3295ddf630dfa33e5e1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, video walkthroughs at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Do we want the top menu stay as it is or offer drop-downs?  The latter
</I>&gt;<i> reduces the number of clicks but one may prefer to always land on the
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm against drop-down lists.  They're really really difficult to navigate
</I>&gt;<i> from mobile devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Is the current distinction between more permanent news (managed by
</I>&gt;<i> hand) and RSS feeds enough?  Also, one would certainly like to add
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Preliminary program is available&quot; under &quot;OCaml 2013&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is something that I'd consider to be a new 'news' story and would be
</I>&gt;<i> a bookmarked story (replacing the previous one).  Anything more than that
</I>&gt;<i> starts to feel complicated with not much gain.  Do you feel differently?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Do we want a &quot;Read more&quot; button under &quot;OCaml is an industrial...&quot;?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> rather a &quot;What is OCaml?&quot; under &quot;Learn&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably a good idea but I'm extremely wary of adding too many
</I>&gt;<i> links on the front page.  The more links there are, the less likely I feel
</I>&gt;<i> anyone is to click them.  Having said that, a 'read more', or something
</I>&gt;<i> like it, does make sense for the intro paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - In the &quot;Packages&quot; table, do we really want an &quot;author&quot; column?  The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Package&quot; column is already not wide enough.  One could also think about
</I>&gt;<i> putting in a tooltip the single line describing the package.  Finally, I do
</I>&gt;<i> not think OPAM has a &quot;Category&quot; field ATM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm perfectly happy to drop the Author column in the package list, and
</I>&gt;<i> probably Category too (I can't remember when/why I added that - I was
</I>&gt;<i> probably thinking of tags, which we do want).  I'm expecting this table to
</I>&gt;<i> be fairly easy to iterate on so I'm not too concerned about it at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment (just as long as it exists)
</I>&gt;<i>
