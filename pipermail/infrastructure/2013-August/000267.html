Indeed.

&gt;<i> While I am at it, I remember that &quot;extension points&quot; were evoked.

</I>&gt;<i> it visible).  Is there any design for this ATM?
</I>
At this moment (it took me a while to figure out what ATM meant), 
there is no design for what you mention.

On 25 Jul 2013, at 17:08, Thomas Gazagnaire &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">thomas at gazagnaire.org</A>&gt; wrote that, which I believe is roughly the same thing:
&gt;<i> Last point, I use to have an extension of Mauricio's markdown parser which is able to tag a specific elements with an HTML class (example: @foo{Bla bla} to generate &lt;span class=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;Bla bla&lt;/span&gt;). This is not standard, but very useful when you can tweak the associated CSS, and I'd be very happy if I can add it later to your parser without too much trouble.
</I>
Well, eventually omd will parse an extended version of Markdown. Although the code (at least currently) is not very pretty (mainly because it's still the first iteration), I believe it is (already) **very** simple to understand how it's built in order to add one's own extension. Slightly modifying an existing behaviour might not be so trivial.
What I mean is that, if one wants to add a construction such as 
@@foo@@
which would be the equivalent of
&lt;span class=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;This is a useless extension of Markdown&lt;/span&gt;
it's trivial (mainly thanks to OCaml pattern matching).
If one wants to slightly change the parsing of lists, it might be causing headaches&#8230;
If one wants to completely rewrite the parsing of lists, well, it will still cause headaches but that would not be because of existing code.

&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> C.

Best,
Philippe
