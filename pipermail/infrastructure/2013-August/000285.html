Thanks, they have been very useful (in making me not sleep last night).
Two questions: 
1. is there a license? (I think they are already in my repo, Jeremy added a bunch of test files and I think that they're the same)
2. in url-with-parenthesis.md there is 
There's an [episode](<A HREF="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Darmok_(episode">http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Darmok_(episode</A>)) of Star Trek: The Next Generation
How do you end up with a URL that includes the first closing parenthesis? It is because you count the number of opening parentheses in the URL? Or does it naively take the farthest one before a space or newline or end-of-file?

Oh, I've just seen that it's the last test&#8230; It means I've almost finished the 1st testing pass.
I'll have to at least make a 2nd pass to check that I haven't broken anything while fixing other things.
Well, there's already that &quot;paragraphs in lists&quot; I have to fix. I don't quite understand the point in Markdown generating so many paragraphs...

&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to try it out, your feedbacks will be welcome. Note that for the moment, the binary doesn't parse its arguments, so it's all about stdin and stdout.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to make everybody happy, the simple 'extension point' mechanism is to add a way to add HTML tags to some word/paragraph (and a way to load css &amp; javascript files in the generated HTML file). I've never seen any markdown engine doing this, but that would be incredibly useful (at least for me).
</I>&gt;<i> [&#8230;]
</I>
I'll reply to that later :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> N.B. I'll probably add a table of contents extension, eventually.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can be interested in <A HREF="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow/blob/master/lib/markdown.ml#L456">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow/blob/master/lib/markdown.ml#L456</A>
</I>
I'll take a look at that&#8230; later. :-)

Cheers,
Philippe
