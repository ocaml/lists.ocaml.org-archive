Well, I don't care to the extend of arguing a lot about this, I mean
I'll deal with whatever fits better for others on this point.
However for what it's worth, having to keep the companies/institutions
up to date is not something I look for. In my case, for instance, I
was at University of Cambridge when I joined the ocaml.org team, then
I went to ANSYS Esterel Technologies, then I worked for another
company, and now I'm at BeSport. It'd be a bit annoying to me to keep
that up to date. But again, if it has to be done, I'm ok with it.


&gt;&gt;<i> With that, I totally concur. That list is on

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not going to update it because I don't know the up-to-date list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One example comes to mind: David Sheets has been a maintainer for

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has it ever been up to date ? I thought Thomas was a member with commit
</I>&gt;<i> rights already at that time...
</I>
Git log indicates that Thomas had commit rights in 2013, and even
2012... also in 2015...  &#244;&#212;
So the list has never really been up-to-date! :'D

&gt;<i> If you have access to the github repo, could
</I>&gt;<i> you send the complete list in this thread ?
</I>
I don't have the access that would permit me to see that list. (Or I
do, but then I haven't found how.)
Amir, Anil?

Also, it'd be worth listing who have access to the server hosting
ocaml.org, as I suppose that would make a different list.
