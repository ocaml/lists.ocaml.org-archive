I would feel exactly the opposite way. If ocaml.org wants to be seen as a
community website, it should have a lot of members from the community.
Restricting the number of members a priori means we don't trust the
community, and we put all the power in the hands of a few people. Why
should we trust them more than other OCaml users ? I have already raised my
concern about the lack of democracy in the current governance, the
organization is top-down, when a community organization should be bottom-up.


&gt;<i> Mauny is being kept despite not meeting the above criteria, but he meets a
</I>&gt;<i> different one: the INRIA team should have 1 person on the list since they
</I>&gt;<i> want to and they own the domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Michel Mauny is not working at Inria, and not in the Gallium team (he is
working at ENSTA, working from time to time at IRILL, and a member of
ocaml.org because he organized OCaml'2014). To the best of my knowledge, I
am the only member of Gallium that has had any interest in being part of
ocaml.org, so the argument is a bit counter-productive, unless you want to
support my membership in the project...


&gt;<i> Louis, I have no objection to adding you since you contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> community in plenty of ways. However, can you please explain what your
</I>&gt;<i> contribution to ocaml.org has been or will be. Why do you want access?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting question. Would you actually ask also the current members to
write such a statement to back their current membership ?


&gt;<i> Regarding listing people's organizations, this was discussed before, and I
</I>&gt;<i> proposed: people's organization be listed if their contribution to
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml.org is on behalf of that organization. In other words, if you want
</I>&gt;<i> to add your organization after your name, go ahead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The whole point of adding the company is to avoid a company from having too
much power over the site, but if it's a choice, then it makes the whole
thing useless.
