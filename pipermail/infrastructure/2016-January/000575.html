Me too. Only problem is it is unclear Fabrice wants this. I've had some
offline exchanges with him, and he clearly expressed an opposite interest.
Of course that contradicts his other comments, so now I'm confused. I hope
he'll clarify.

I agree, but the constructive criticism should be directed only at Fabrice.
He is the only one whose comments have been accusatory (with no evidence to
back up those accusations). As you can see above, I'm willing even now to
fully trust him.

I'd also like to clarify my proposal to remove people from the committers.
I don't actually care to do this but don't think all of their names should
be listed on the ocaml.org admin page as official members of the project.
The reason is they don't view themselves that way, so it is misleading.
However, Fabrice insists on burying us in bureaucracy by making the actual
committers be in sync with the posted list. So then I felt we should remove
some people from the committers.
