Subject: [ocaml-infra] Trouble building OPAM on Fedora 20

Hi,

I'm trying to build OPAM from source on Fedora 20, and I'm getting the
following error:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/soule/opam/src_ext'
tar xfz dose3-3.1.2.tar.gz

..

make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/soule/opam/src_ext'
make[1]: *** [clone] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/soule/opam'

Can anyone suggest a fix?

thank you,
Robert

Does anyone know the status of opam-doc. Are we closer to having nice
documentation easily generated for all of our installed libraries?

Hi Ashish,

I will be rewriting the opam-doc tool over the summer as part of work
towards the OCaml platform. Should hopefully have something usable by
September.

The `bin-doc` parts of the tool (which previously parsed documentation
comments and stored them in ".cmd" files) have already been rewritten as
a compiler patch to parse comments and store them in ".cmt" files as
special attributes (on github as pr #51). Unfortunately this patch did
not get into 4.02 as there were some concern over parts of it. I hope to
address these concerns over the summer as well.

Regards,

Leo

Do note that the 'opam-doc' package in OPAM does work at the moment.

It's just not integrated into the compiler, but it does do enough to
compile up the Core docs at Jane Street or the mirage.github.io docs.
We're unlikely to do any bugfixes to that though, as the effort is
going into the new version that Leo describes below.

Great, thanks. It'll be nice to have this.
