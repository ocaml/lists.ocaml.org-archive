Dear all,

I've been working on putting together wireframes to demonstrate aspects of the design and functionality we'd like to introduce into the OCaml.org website.  Today, I published a blog post summarising this work, which includes screencasts and a link to a clickable demo you can play with.

Hi

Very impressive work!!

One question:
even without fonts and colors, the wireframes are supposed to be about page
layout, right?
On the videos, the pseudo-browser is higher than wider while most people
seem to have nowadays w > h.
Is there a way to view how the layout is intended to adapt to other "page
geometries" (or to mobile-browsers by the way)? or is it too early in the
design?


Thanks & Cheers
Seb

Hi Seb, Thanks for the feedback.

You're right about the width vs height and in these wireframes you're actually seeing the whole page at once.  All displays (apart from phones) should see the full width of the page but may have to scroll to see content further down the page.  People on large monitors may not have to scroll far.  I should point out that I fixed the width of these wireframes at 1024 wide, which is similar to tablet resolutions.  On wider monitors, we'd likely add more whitespace either side so as to avoid stretching the content too far.

There isn't a straightforward way to see how the site would look from a mobile without explicitly wireframing it that way, but we are conscious of it.  Since we're using the bootstrap [1] grid, we do get mobile-friendly views for free, provided we arrange the content well.  As an example, visit the bootstrap site (below) from a desktop and slowly reduce the width of your browser window.  You'll see how the content reflows to fit the window until it eventually becomes a single column (as I see it on my phone).

Hello,

> On wider monitors, we'd likely add more whitespace either side so as to avoid stretching the content too far.

W.r.t. page layout stretchability but on the narrower side, a good test to have in mind is to check if on a laptop you can have an 80-columns text editor and the documentation side by side without needing horizontal scrolling.

Regarding the Modules tab I'm not sure I understood you well so it may already be the idea. But if the package has a single module it would be nice if it shows directly the documentation of that module to save one useless click. 

Also, it's more a comment for opam, but it would be nice if the documentation system could do the same locally with the same experience but showing you only the documentation of your installed packages (with a landing page that lists the packages and their respective modules for direct access).

Best,

Daniel

Hadn't thought of that so I'll bear it in mind. However, it may still depend on the resolution of the laptop in question (eg I have a 'retina' MacBook which has more horizontal space than my old laptop). 


> Regarding the Modules tab I'm not sure I understood you well so it may already be the idea. But if the package has a single module it would be nice if it shows directly the documentation of that module to save one useless click. 

Yes, that's the plan. I did mention it but probably wasn't clear enough.

Yes, this is also something we want :)  It's not just an opam thing as it involves Leo's upcoming work on documentation, as well as using packages like cow, opam2web, weberizer etc. Doing this locally, would enable the creation of properly cross-referenced docs for a particular user's environment. 

Best wishes,
Amir

Hello,

Thanks for this presentation. This made me think about the future of the
Caml Hump. Now that Opam is the ocaml package manager, would it be
possible to merge Opam and Hump ?

I mean: could it be possible to create some kind of "info" packages in
opam to indicate that a library/tool/... exists but is not packaged
yet ? With a flag to make them appear in opam list and search ?

This could encourage contributors to package not yet packaged tools and
libs.

Regarding tags, it is possible that I missed the information, but is
opam going to handle tags associated to packages ? (I saw some
tag-based search in packages in Amir's demos)

With these "info" packages and a tag system, opam should be able to
replace the hump, allowing anobody to contribute to (this
replacmenet of) the hump.

At last, I also saw in Amir's demos news feeds associated to packages.
Will the RSS feed be indicated in opam package information ?

Regards,

Maxence

That lead me to think about oasis-db in fact. You can upload .tar.gz
directly into oasis-db and get it easily (there is a REST API to get
data out of oasis-db). We also already have an RSS feed et al. The
only missing piece is a command line tool to upload (half a lie, since
the tool exists but is not released).

I think merging providing Hump info through OASIS-DB is a 0day work.

The RSS:
http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/feeds/rss2

The API:
http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/api/

Looking at the wireframe, I think we should also consider displaying
GODI and OASIS-DB information. This can be very useful to dev that can
quickly see that there are 1 version behind of a package (e.g.
ocaml-expect is lagging one version behind in OPAM wrt to OASIS-DB).

You can already create "empty" packages with a dummy build instruction which just display "NOT PACKAGED YET!" and exit with a non-zero code, but I doubt this would be very helpful to the user (and quite frustrating). But why not ...

Yup, OPAM 1.0.0 supports tags but we haven't advertise that properly yet (the priority was to release the tool with all the rights features in). Now we can concentrate on the package metadata themselves.

If you look at section 1.2.4 of the dev-manual[1] your can see that you can add these new fields in the .opam:

homepage: "url"
authors: [ "me" "you" ]
tags: [ "foo" "bar" ]

I encourage everybody with some spare time to add these relevant fields to the existing package metadata :-) Bonus points if you come-up with some automatic tools to do this.
For the tag conventions, I'm pretty in favor of re-using the great work that has already been put in the hump. Is there a list of tags and their description available somewhere ?

You can query the tags on the command line: `opam info foo -f tags` will display the tags associated to the package foo but I just realize that the search function doesn't look at the tags yet ... I've opened [2] to to keep track of this.

> At last, I also saw in Amir's demos news feeds associated to packages.
> Will the RSS feed be indicated in opam package information ?

This is a great idea, I'm not sure how to do this properly yet but that's something what we really aim for (ie. give the user the ability to get quick feedback on a given package). This is now tracked by [3].

Apart from putting information in form, which is the longest part of
course.

Well, this is a oasis-db feed, not a per-package feed as such one
appeared in Amir's demos, on the Core package page.

I think there should be one and only one place to put information about
packages feeding the ocaml.org website.

I can extract it, but it may not be the best one. Some kind of merge
with oasis-db tags could be better. Of course, there should not be any
restriction on tags, but a way to list the tags used in existing
packages should be useful to choose appropriate ones for a new package.
Something like `opam tag -l`.

The only real field to fill in the URL where you can download the
.tar.gz and its optional (in this case we use a local copy). The order
parameter should be correct if you don't have a crazy versionning
scheme.

The package name and version are guessed based on configure.ac/META
file or _oasis . The name/version are only editable when we have to
guess (i.e. no _oasis in the tarball).

I would say uploading a tarball and filling 1 field in a form is not a
big deal. The command line interface allows you to directly upload the
tarball with the URL (good for automatisation).

Sorry, read too fast. I will probably add a couple of fields like
ProjectRSSFeed, ProjectGooglePlus, ProjectGithub and ProjectTwitter to
_oasis.

Also, I am wondering if it is not damaging to have a feed with very
little news for pakcages (Core has content in its feed, but this is
not a general case). E.g. there is a lot of small projects/libraries.

I beg you to reconsider this. I know it is easier and nicer to have
only one package manager and one place to look for, but I don't think
skipping other sources is good. You should at least consider the
option to do so. I really don't want to see GODI and OASIS-DB removed
from the big picture.

For my packages I started to generate opam files from _oasis files, some things are still missing (.install files) and the code is ad-hoc (e.g it won't handle complex dependencies specs) but it mostly works for my packages and can be used as a starting point. The relevant parts are:

https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/blob/master/build#L46
https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner/blob/master/build#L122

Don't ask me what these sed invocations actually do? The results can be seen here:

The aim of the Caml Hump was just to list existing software (and
eventually documentation resources, but these can be listed somewhere
else, on the ocaml.org site for example). Some of these existing
software don't even have a tar.gz, nor a version number, and even less
a META or _oasis file. But still I think it's important that they
appear somewhere as potential packages, work in progress, and
generally as existing code base.

So the system where they should be listed should put as less
constraints as possible.

I think software libs or tools authors provide RSS feed when there is a
minimum posts/announces/... activity. RSS feed is not mandatory, but
when it exists it would be useful to see it on a package page.

In this case, a merging must be done from various sources. This can be
done using the homepage of the lib or tool for example; reading all
information from various sources for a lib or tool, and merging, hoping
there are no conflict.

This relates to multiple projects, but FYI we have an issue about this on
the ocaml.org repo:

Agreed.

We can do this with an OPAM development remote that has a snapshot of
these unreleased packages.  The web page can simply combine a number
of remotes to form the final list, without polluting our stable default
remote.

We've had a number of upstream distfiles disappear recently, and some
have done so permanently.  Thomas, I guess we need to think about
mirroring the original upstream distfiles somewhere in addition to the
OPAM-wrapped version which we currently do.
