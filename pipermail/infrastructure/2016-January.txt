Hi all,

It seems that no one at OCamlPro has admin (or even write) rights to 
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org anymore ; as far as I know, Thomas used to 
have them on behalf of OCamlPro.

Would it be possible to add these back ?

Best,
Louis

As far as I know, it's not a question of OCamlPro or not OCamlPro, it's a
question of individuals.
So, who at OCamlPro wants to be an admin? (the answer to that should be a
list of names, which can be empty as well as one that includes all members
of OCamlPro, although it would appear a little weird in the latter case).

That's right -- it should be a person and not an organisation.

Louis, you would be the most appropriate person since you already maintain opam.ocaml.org.  If you and others on the list have no objection, I'll add you to the admin group.

Anil

Indeed, and this has been discussed before when we were adopting the governance doc -- Maintainers are individuals (I'm on a phone but I'll try and find the thread later).

Sounds good to me! Louis, please also add your name to the list at http://ocaml.org/about.html

Best wishes,

Happy New Year everyone,

When OCaml.org and OCaml-lang.org (ocamlpro's upgrade of OCaml.org) were
merged, it was agreed that Ocamlpro would have a committer, to prevent the
site from freezing by the lack of free time of its other members. Thomas
became an admin, but now, as he is not Ocamlpro anymore, adding Louis would
check the box (it seems that all my work on OCaml-lang.org and on the
French translation of OCaml.org were not enough to be granted any
rights...).

Could you publish the current list of members with write-access, and the
organizations they currently work for ? I think such a list should be kept
up-to-date on the website, for transparency, as Github does not publish it.

Best regards,
-Fabrice

Well, I'm not so sure that the organisations are very relevant...

With that, I totally concur. That list is on
http://ocaml.org/about.html as Amir mentioned, however it's clearly
not up to date. :(
I'm not going to update it because I don't know the up-to-date list.
One example comes to mind: David Sheets has been a maintainer for
quite a while now and he's not on the list.

Cheers,
Philippe

Any organization that wants to be transparent must do that. Who would trust
an organization to be independant if most members are paid by the same
company ?

Has it ever been up to date ? I thought Thomas was a member with commit
rights already at that time... If you have access to the github repo, could
you send the complete list in this thread ?

Well, I don't care to the extend of arguing a lot about this, I mean
I'll deal with whatever fits better for others on this point.
However for what it's worth, having to keep the companies/institutions
up to date is not something I look for. In my case, for instance, I
was at University of Cambridge when I joined the ocaml.org team, then
I went to ANSYS Esterel Technologies, then I worked for another
company, and now I'm at BeSport. It'd be a bit annoying to me to keep
that up to date. But again, if it has to be done, I'm ok with it.

Git log indicates that Thomas had commit rights in 2013, and even
2012... also in 2015...  ??
So the list has never really been up-to-date! :'D

I don't have the access that would permit me to see that list. (Or I
do, but then I haven't found how.)
Amir, Anil?

Also, it'd be worth listing who have access to the server hosting
ocaml.org, as I suppose that would make a different list.

Indeed, sorry if I wasn't clear enough, that's precisely what I was asking 
for: that at least one _person_ from OCamlPro gets access.

If everybody is happy with me getting access, all the best!

Thanks!

Damn, my secret power is now known: I can commit to every repository containing "ocaml" in their name on GitHub :p

More seriously, I think I was able to push there unofficially because I was part of the "ocaml" organisation (as I helped Anil to set up the organisation initially). GitHub fixed their organisation ACLs recently so normally I should not be able to do it anymore if I am not in the team.

And also yes, I was in the initial ocaml.org team when I was at OCamlPro. I gladly give my seat to Louis or Fabrice :p

Thanks Thomas, but the problem is : the governance says we need a consensus
of the current members to add a new one, but the list of current members is
unknown... :-)

Dear all, (+CC Xavier Leroy as an FYI)

Yes, this list should certainly be kept up-to-date.  The current set of ocaml.org-dev maintainers are:

- agarwal
- amirmc
- Chris00
- dsheets
- eelsther
- gildor478
- lpw25
- mauny
- pw374
- samoht
- AltGr (just added as requested).

Note that I am not on this list -- since the move of the compiler to the same organisation, I am dropping admin privileges for my account and am not an ocaml.org maintainer.  If one of the maintainers could update the list, I'd appreciate it.

Fabrice also said:
> it seems that all my work on OCaml-lang.org <http://ocaml-lang.org/> and on the French translation of OCaml.org <http://ocaml.org/> were not enough to be granted any rights...

Have you actually explicitly requested access?  I don't believe that rights are ever granted, which perhaps they should be.  I certainly have no objection to you having merge access for your hard work on ocaml.org and ocaml-lang.org. As long as all commits go through PRs and there is broad consensus for changes, we should expand the maintainer list to anyone willing to spend time on the website.

best,
Anil

Exactly, so in fact having commit rights to ocaml/ocaml.org is not about
being able to make contributions. Everyone can do that by way of a pull
request. I'd rather we kept the list of direct committers to fewer people,
and not keep strictly increasing the size of the list. The director
committers should be people who can be trusted to review pull requests.
This means: you have a reasonable understanding of the code base and
ocaml.org policies, and a broad understanding of the website's content. We
should remove people who have not been active in these ways. I propose the
list be:

- agarwal
- amirmc
- Chris00
- dsheets
- mauny
- pw374

Mauny is being kept despite not meeting the above criteria, but he meets a
different one: the INRIA team should have 1 person on the list since they
want to and they own the domain.

Louis, I have no objection to adding you since you contribute to the
community in plenty of ways. However, can you please explain what your
contribution to ocaml.org has been or will be. Why do you want access?

Regarding listing people's organizations, this was discussed before, and I
proposed: people's organization be listed if their contribution to ocaml.org
is on behalf of that organization. In other words, if you want to add your
organization after your name, go ahead.

I would feel exactly the opposite way. If ocaml.org wants to be seen as a
community website, it should have a lot of members from the community.
Restricting the number of members a priori means we don't trust the
community, and we put all the power in the hands of a few people. Why
should we trust them more than other OCaml users ? I have already raised my
concern about the lack of democracy in the current governance, the
organization is top-down, when a community organization should be bottom-up.

Michel Mauny is not working at Inria, and not in the Gallium team (he is
working at ENSTA, working from time to time at IRILL, and a member of
ocaml.org because he organized OCaml'2014). To the best of my knowledge, I
am the only member of Gallium that has had any interest in being part of
ocaml.org, so the argument is a bit counter-productive, unless you want to
support my membership in the project...

Interesting question. Would you actually ask also the current members to
write such a statement to back their current membership ?

The whole point of adding the company is to avoid a company from having too
much power over the site, but if it's a choice, then it makes the whole
thing useless.

Restricting the number of members a priori means we don't trust the community, and we put all the power in the hands of a few people. Why should we trust them more than other OCaml users ? I have already raised my concern about the lack of democracy in the current governance, the organization is top-down, when a community organization should be bottom-up.

My understanding is that anyone can submit a PR -- it's just merge access that is given to a maintainer.  The line here is pretty blurry, but I would side with being generous with it and dealing with exceptions as they arise.  It's all tracked in Git after all, so everything can be reverted if something does go wrong.  If a maintainer goes "rogue" and makes wide-scale changes, it can all be addressed quite rapidly.

To the best of my knowledge, I am the only member of Gallium that has had any interest in being part of ocaml.org <http://ocaml.org/>, so the argument is a bit counter-productive, unless you want to support my membership in the project...

My understanding is that Michel got merge access as he was an OCaml Workshop chair, and had to update the pages directly.

That's a fair request.

Ashish: Louis' contributions also include opam.ocaml.org via opam2web. I'm keen to see these converge in the longer term, as it's a huge chunk of content that is very separate from the current ocaml.org.

Honestly, the set of people involved here are too small to quibble over this point...

It welcomes *all* members of the community to contribute. We're only
talking about who has the responsibility to review and accept contributions
for quality control purposes. It is entirely common practice for public
open-source projects to restrict the final committers, otherwise chaos
ensues with completely random contributions.


Michel Mauny is not working at Inria...

Sorry, my mistake. I may have completely misunderstood Mauny's role. I'm in
favor of removing him too. He only need access during the time he was
running OCaml 2014 to avoid delays in pushing content. He has made no other
contributions and has not expressed any interest in doing so.

Yes I would, except I don't need to because I already know the answer.

My question was posed to Louis, and I have not received an answer from him.
It has been made clear to you that membership on the ocaml.org project is
for individuals, not organizations. Thus, in this matter, I'm still
awaiting a reply from Louis.

You are creating a mountain out of a mole hill. The list isn't exactly that
big. It's pretty clear who the people are and where they work. Are you
actually suspicious about some company exerting undue control over ocaml.org?
We're a small community that is already overstretched, so let's avoid
addressing completely unrealistic hypothetical scenarios.

Furthermore, I disagree with you in principle. People have the right to do
various kinds of work independent of their employer. If that is the case
for someone, it is wrong to list their employer's name since it incorrectly
affiliates the employer with some project they are not involved with.

As Anil mentionned, I don't have direct contributions to ocaml.org itself, 
but maintain the services at opam.ocaml.org. In this regard, it would maybe 
make more sense to give the access to ocaml.org.git to Fabrice rather than me 
-- I believe we'd be happy with either (or, of course, both).

Also, in this matter as well as other ongoing ones, I believe things would be 
much easier if each party accepted to trust the others a little more. Nobody 
is tring to harm the other ones or has a secret agenda...

I'd prefer to give both Louis and Fabrice merge access to ocaml.org.

Me too. Only problem is it is unclear Fabrice wants this. I've had some
offline exchanges with him, and he clearly expressed an opposite interest.
Of course that contradicts his other comments, so now I'm confused. I hope
he'll clarify.

I agree, but the constructive criticism should be directed only at Fabrice.
He is the only one whose comments have been accusatory (with no evidence to
back up those accusations). As you can see above, I'm willing even now to
fully trust him.

I'd also like to clarify my proposal to remove people from the committers.
I don't actually care to do this but don't think all of their names should
be listed on the ocaml.org admin page as official members of the project.
The reason is they don't view themselves that way, so it is misleading.
However, Fabrice insists on burying us in bureaucracy by making the actual
committers be in sync with the posted list. So then I felt we should remove
some people from the committers.

If nobody is against, then it is a consensus ! Wonderful, let's do it !

And my organization should be Inria/OCamlPro/Irill/Oups/mySelf :-)

I have added you to the ocaml.org-dev team -- Louis was already a member. Welcome!

I suggest that a first PR might be for the new maintainer to add themselves to the maintainer list on the website :-)

Hi,

I just compiled ocaml.org (github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org) and got this error:
File "site/learn/tutorials/camlp4_3.10/pa_foreach3.ml", line 29,
characters 15-31:

This is from master branch.
What is the most stable version/branch/tag I can compile ocaml.org for

I was trying to find the info about most up-to-date stable verion, but
there is none.

Hi,

Never mind my previous question regarding compile error.
I compiled successfully with ocaml 4.01.0. (I failed with ocaml 4.02.3).

Thanks

Seungjin

Hi,

I just compiled ocaml.org (github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org) and got this error:
File "site/learn/tutorials/camlp4_3.10/pa_foreach3.ml", line 29,
characters 15-31:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type
         Camlp4.PreCast.Syntax.Ast.patt = Camlp4.PreCast.Ast.patt
make[3]: *** [site/learn/tutorials/camlp4_3.10/pa_foreach3.cmo] Error 2
make[2]: *** [gen_md] Error 2
make[1]: *** [staging] Error 2
make: *** [local] Error 2

This is from master branch.
What is the most stable version/branch/tag I can compile ocaml.org for
my translation test?
I was trying to find the info about most up-to-date stable verion, but
there is none.

Regards,

Seungjin

Glad you got it working. Obviously a refresh of the code to compile with
the latest OCaml would be nice. In the mean time, I recommend creating a
separate opam switch for working with ocaml.org. Also note you generally
shouldn't have to compile the site to contribute content.

Resending to the list as I seem to be bad at email:

Hi Seungjin,

Sorry about the hassle. I think
<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/662> is tracking the
4.01-only issue. It is a maintenance task that really needs to be done
but hasn't been seen as critical and so has been avoided.

Thanks for your contributions,

David
