I'm a little confused -- the intention behind git.ocaml.org is to act
as a mirror for major OCaml repositories, so putting a dependency on Forge
doesn't seem right.  What's the goal of the scripts you are talking about
below?

I'm thinking that we simply specify a list of Git URLs somewhere, and
they are picked up by git.ocaml.org to publish as a mirror.  That could
include a list exported by the Forge of its projects (that use Git), as
well as others on GitHub.

Having a project on the forge will provide:
- a public list of member of the project (i.e. you know who to ping
when there is a problem)
- maintenance of the system hosting your project will be taken care by
someone else (including e.g. backup, system upgrade)
- adding a member to the project will be easier (vs if you are hosting
this on your host, you will have to create a user + add his ssh key)

What is precisely git.ocaml.org ?

If this is a VM or a physical host, I think you will slightly increase
the TCO of *.ocaml.org. If this is a virtual host inside OCamlLab, you
may have concern to add external contributor. The benefit to have it
separate is that if github and the OCaml forge will be down at the
same time, you still have no problem.

But all in all, the benefit of hosting it on the forge is not huge,
this may just be convenient for allowing other people to take care of
it and getting rid of some system maintainance. So I am not pushing
hard on this, I just think it is a good idea.

The scheme to synchronize will be the same in both case (cronjob +
list of url + a shell script).

Does it make sense to you ?

I think Anil's idea is not to provide an active place where people can
work on a given project (like the forge or Github), but a still place
that exposes the state of development of some projects that are
developed *elsewhere*. The counterpart, for versioned source code, of
what a read-only mailing-list archive is with respect to the actual
mailing-list server.

If you take the OCaml compiler/distribution for example, a lot of the
development is happening on the official SVN, and people also have
forks spread in decentralized systems, but if I want to point someone
to a specific commit or part of the source code, one solution today is
to use the github.org/ocaml/ocaml mirror (whose interface is
admittedly more convenient than the webSVN stuff available on the
official SVN). Having a git.ocaml.org/ocaml could replace github for
that need (but there wouldn't be any development happening there).

Something I'm personally wondering about is whether gitlab could also
be used to support the git-based workflows that surround opam,
ocamlot, etc. That's sensibly harder as this does require interaction,
and I can undertand that Anil, that has invested significant time to
learn github's scripting API, would not be keen on moving to a
different platform that could remain technically subpar for a long
time. (And keeping both in sync. would probably be a pain.)

This is correct -- I want a longer term mirror that'll stick around for
published code even if the upstream disappears for whatever reason.

I view the Forge much like GitHub -- a development environment, and I
don't want to intertwine them for this reason.

In the long term, yes, but in the short-term, we gain a lot from the
network effort of GitHub.  We've got various projects on the boil
that'll ensure we don't stay locked into GitHub forever, though.

Just realize that maybe I was not clear on a very simple thing:

The point is not to use the Forge VCS repositories infrastructure,
this is just to create a group of user and use the fact that you can
have cronjob with scripts running. You can just consider this as
"hosting" the group and have a place to create, run script and have
the result visible (usually on YOURPROJECT.forge.ocamlcore.org but
injecting an alias from git.ocaml.org to
YOURPROJECT.forge.ocamlcore.org is a 2 minutes work).

Is it more clear ?

Am I still missing something ?

Cheers

I'm still confused by this. What Anil and Gabriel pointed out makes sense to me (having a mirror of certain repos) and was discussed in the past. You seem to be talking about a method for managing a group of users but I don't actually see why that's necessary here. 

Best wishes,
Amir

I realize that I am not clear.

The goal is to create a mirror (full ACK here). I have no question
concerning this point.

I am only proposing to host it as a project on the forge. That was the
reason of my question about "what is git.ocaml.org ? (a VM or a
physical host or whatever)". I am not discussing the use or the way to
do it, but just would like to see it the data mirrored project hosted
on the forge.

The reason I am pushing for that: do you remember COCAN ? We should
avoid hosting important services on server that have no admin backup.
If you want something to last long, you should be able to easily share
it with other people. If we spread our ocaml.org admin over multiple
host, that just increase the cost of maintainance.

Cheers
Sylvain

Dear caml-list,

We're close to releasing the new design of ocaml.org but need help from the community to identify and fix bugs before we switch next week.

Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing how we should go about this and below is the plan for migration.  If you'd like to discuss any of this, then the infrastructure list is the best place to do so (cced).

1. We've made a new branch on the main ocaml.org repository [1] with the redesign.  This branch is a fork of the main one and we've simply cleaned up and replayed our git commits there.

2. We've built a live version of the new site, which is visible at http://preview.ocaml.org - this is rebuilt every few minutes from the branch mentioned above.  

3. Over the course of one week, we ask the community to review the new site and report any bugs or problems on the issue tracker [2]. We triage those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the phase we'll be in from *today*.

4. After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we merge the site into the main branch.  This would effectively present the new site to the world.  

During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on the old site but would be happy to accept them on the new branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.  

Please note that the above is only intended to merge the *design* and *toolchain* for the new site.  Specifically, we've created new landing pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site's contents as well as made some new libraries [3, 4].  The new toolchain means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a lot easier.  

Since the files are on GitHub, people don't even need to clone the site locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the 'Edit this page' link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the repository and GitHub's editing and pull request features will allow you to make changes and submit updates, all from within your browser [5].  

There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed and merged.

I must admit I'm a bit lost in this message that mixes process
discussions with a request for participation.

Would you consider sending a separate mail formulated purely as a call
for participation (focusing on the "please help us this week" part
only), with some details on what you're looking for? If I understand
correctly, this is not about the phoney content of the new website,
but about its look&feel and general user interaction (if this is
correct, you should stress it). Giving a couple of examples of bugs
you've fixed in the past that correspond to what you're looking for
now would be helpful.

I'd say it thjs way: Your help may consist in reporting bugs (which would be fixed by someone else) or fixing bugs, or fixing the contents (this mainly means "text contents"), etc.
But please concentrate, for the 7 following days, on things that would prevent this new site from replacing the current one.
(Then, we will work on the rest, i.e., things that need to be fixed but are not blocking.)

For "text contents", the "Edit this page" on the bottom of most pages should lead you to the right file to edit. :)

Just a nitpick. I like the changing geometry dependent on the width of the
window, but on the "Learn" page, with the middle geometry, the code example
is terribly line-wrapped.

Amir,

Are all bugs related to redesign are marked with `redesign` tag? I
ask, because very small count of opened bugs are tagged with
`redesign`. Can I rely on tagged questions  when I will check is my
bug reported or not?

Kind regards,
Kakadu

Thanks Lukasz!  I've captured this on the tracker [2] so we can figure out how to improve it.

Dear Kakadu, 

Yes, they'll be tagged as `redesign` but there may be a delay between submitting an issue and seeing it tagged.  Apologies for that but don't worry about submitting duplicates as we'll cross reference and close any dupes as we triage.

Thanks!
Amir

Amir, is the live book being kept up to date?  I see lots of commits
and bugs being resolved, but it's not obviously showing up on
preview.ocaml.org.

Actually, ignore that.  On further investigation, the patch I was
looking for really has been applied.

Sorry for the noise.

Hi Amir,

I sent PR#210 (https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/210) against
the redesign branch. What is the status of this pull request ? I would
really like to see adding the G+ OCaml community to the community page
before the new design is out.

Regards
Sylvain

We're nearly at the end of the bug hunt and only have two blocking issues to deal with.  These should be closed soon and we will then be able to merge the design into the live site and continue improvements there.  

Ashish, Christophe, regarding the deployment phase, I think it would be better to do that on Monday rather than the end of this week.  My reasoning is that should anything need our attention, we'll be better prepared to deal with it on a weekday, rather than encroaching on a weekend.  Does that sound ok to you?

As a side note, it's encouraging that people have also been suggesting improvements to content during this phase [2].  I hope to see much more community activity in that regard over the coming weeks!

Deployment on Monday sounds okay to me. We'll need to adjust the DNS
settings, which I think Anil has to do.

I'll be on a flight back to Cambridge on Monday, but I can do a final check through preview and switch it over on Tuesday afternoon when I'm back.  Does that work?

Hi folks,

We've only got 3 blocking issues left [1], and as soon as those are closed, we'll be able to switch to the new site.  I'm expecting that will be tomorrow afternoon (UK time).  The deployment steps are on issue #184 [2] for those who may like to comment.

I'm extremely grateful to everyone who's taken the time to look over the site and create issues.  We do have a number of open issues but since these are mixture of content updates, feature requests and minor bugs, we'll work on them after the new design is live.

Best wishes,
Amir

Right, this is probably a good time to document the layout a little bit.

opam.ocaml.org is hosted on a Debian VM ; Anil, Thomas and I have accounts there, but everything of interest is in an 'opam' account:

 ~opam
 |-- git
 |   |-- opam     (auto-updated, reset, complied and installed every night)
 |   |-- opam2web (auto-updated, reset, complied and installed every night)
 |   `-- scripts  (version-controlled but without a master upstream atm. No auto-update)
 |-- local        (where the above are installed)
 |   |-- bin
 |   `-- share
 |-- var
 |   `-- log      (holds both the apache logs and cron logs)
 |-- www          (currently deployed opam web. Rebuilt every hour)
 |-- www-bak      (previous version)
 `-- www-new      (version currently being built by the scripts, swapped with www once done)

The scripts include a cron wrapper that fills the logs and reports failures by mail to opam-commits@, a script that synchronises sources with git remotes, and a script that synches the opam repo and web. Should I share them on github ? On a private ocaml repo ?

The crontab is as follows:

 # m h  dom mon dow   command
   0 2  *   *   *     /home/opam/local/bin/cron-wrapper.sh update-opam update-from-git.sh opam
   0 3  *   *   *     /home/opam/local/bin/cron-wrapper.sh update-opam2web update-from-git.sh opam2web
  15 *  *   *   *     /home/opam/local/bin/cron-wrapper.sh update-opam-repo update-opam-repo.sh

Cheers,
Louis

Thanks Louis. It would make sense for all this to be in a repo `
opam.ocaml.org` under the GitHub `ocaml` account. You could include the
scripts and documentation in one place.

The particular reason I was asking is I wanted to submit a few issues and
didn't know where to go. Here are they are:

* Make design consistent with ocaml.org. The opam subdomain is now very
integrated into ocaml.org from an end-user perspective. Yaron reported [1]
that it is jarring to have such a different design. Also, within the opam
subdomain, the front page and opam.o.o/pkg/ pages have a different design.
Ideally, all of *.ocaml.org pages would use the main ocaml.org style sheets.

* Use same Google Analytics account. Right now ocaml.org and
opam.ocaml.orguse different tracking accounts. Anil recommended [2]
that we use the same
code for all *.ocaml.org domains.

Subject: [ocaml-infra] [ANN] New OCaml.org design is now live!
Message-ID: <ACA7BF27-1EC8-4FCD-B99B-332AA9A0F9DF@cam.ac.uk>

Dear caml-list,

As some of you may have noticed, the new OCaml.org site is now live!  

The DNS may still be propagating so if http://ocaml.org hasn't updated for you then try http://166.78.252.20.  This post is in two parts: the first is the announcement and the second is a call for content.


### New OCaml.org website design!

The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the OCaml ecosystem. It's the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the last several months and I'd specifically like to thank Christophe, Ashish and Philippe for their dedication (the commit logs speak volumes).  

We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of wireframes and walk-throughs of the site [1], which then developed into a collection of Photoshop mockups [2].  In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style sheets, which we've adapted to fit our needs across the site.  

Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and workflow we aspired to, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us to develop completely new tools for Markdown and templating in OCaml [3, 4, 5], which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.  Working on all these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I'll write about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.  

The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information on packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forward will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community become involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me to the second part of this post.


### Call for content

We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could do with refreshing and gaps that could be filled.  As a community driven site, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects its members.  

For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you'd like to add yourself to the support page [6]? Perhaps there are tutorials you can help to complete, like 99 problems [7]?  If you're not sure where to begin, there are already a number of content issues you could contribute to [8].  

Although we've gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is still very welcome.  You can either create an issue on the tracker (preferred), or email the infrastructure list. 

It's fantastic how far we've come and I look forward to the next phase!

Best wishes,
Amir
