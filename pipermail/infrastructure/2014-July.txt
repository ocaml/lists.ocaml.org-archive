Subject: [ocaml-infra] Statement of acceptance to the ocaml.org relicensing
Message-ID: <20140731081630.GA11200@notk.org>

Hi,

I hereby agree that my contributions to the ocaml.org website be
relicensed as detailled in the file
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/8561943e67f9f789f86cd3bbc6049a6bbfc9fe4e/LICENSE.md

Some background: I contributed to the website but without going through
github myself and therefore couldn't agree through github (there would
be absolutely no link between the commits, the commiter and that
account); so here is my statement. If a stronger proof is wanted, I can
probably do it too.

Regards,
Adrien Nader
