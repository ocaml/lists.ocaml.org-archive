This sounds good to me.  You should have access rights on the OCaml
organisation to create private repositories, Sylvain. Do you want to try
that out and add your forge setups?  I'll put in manifests for the virtual
machines running here based on those.

I like the look of cgit! Nice and simple, and on my list to install on

Hello! I'm wondering what the process is to get content, such as blog
posts onto ocaml.org.  Does one have to be on planetocaml?  I have a
blog post that I would like to share/get feedback on/etc.

Yes, please add your blog to planet.ocaml.org. You can filter for posts
tagged "ocaml" or whatever in case you don't want all of your posts to show
up on ocaml.org.

And note the frontpage of ocaml.org is currently being updated once every
12 hours, so there might be a delay in seeing your post on
planet.ocaml.orgvs this frontpage. We'll eventually update it more
often, but there's a
slight annoyance in doing it more often right now.

Message-ID: <CAMu2m2KHDdoNZDus0SA3EH7Xn8RiLyRXJfR9mtUa2i8zmuHHjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I started a couple pages on the ocaml.org repo's wiki [1]. The Assets page
will help us know what are all the different pieces that fall under the
ownership of ocaml.org, who manages them, and what they are for.

[1] https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki

Also, I'm not sure whether to use the
ocamlweb-devel at lists.forge.ocamlcore.org list or this one from now on. I
don't mind deleting the former as it isn't widely used. But should all
discussion about ocaml.org go on this infrastructure list?

Hi,

I just created the repository ocaml.org-puppet. I need to upgrade the
current forge installation and will take advantage of this time to populate
this repository with the rule needed.


Don't hesitate to comment, I have my own way of using puppet maybe there
are some experts around that can do better than me ;-)

Don't expect any significant content before I start upgrading
forge.ocamlcore.org -- which will be advertised publicly on caml-list and
feeds.

Regards
Sylvain

Just to keep members of this list updated: weberizer 0.7.2 has been in
OPAM for about a week now.  Please let me know if you encounter

I have added some code (untested) to include ranges of lines in
files.  I have not used it however as it looks rather brittle.  Maybe
we should use some kind of tags to delimit portions of a file we want
to include?

That seems extremely brittle.

We could have something like "include foo.html:id" where id is an attribute
on some tag within foo.html.

But more generally, I'd like to ask whether multi-lingual support is really
feasible? We currently have virtually no pages even in French, some of the
few we have are already out of sync with the English versions, and we lack
the man power to build even the English site.

Any thoughts on simply dropping multi-lingual support?

We could hook into google translate. Taking into account the reality of man
power, google translate does a much better job than us and is far more
comprehensive.

Neither Python, Perl or Haskell has a multi-lingual site, so it's safe to
say that this is not a must-have. I agree with Ashish that we probably lack
man power to do it properly, and I personnally think it would only hurt to
offer broken/incomplete translation.

Another thing: I'm not fond of providing an automatically translated
version of the web site. I've just tried on a couple of pages, and the
result really is broken: good enough to understand approximatively what is
being said, but full of mistakes. Better let those who need it ask google
translate, but not publish a low-quality version of the website.

That was my 2 cent :o)

I think there are a few criteria for keeping a foreign language page:

1) The translation is good.
2) The master English version of the page doesn't change too often, so that
1) will continue to remain valid.
3) The translation is of value.

For example, I think the French menu doesn't meet criteria 3).

By the way, I didn't import most of the foreign language tutorials. See
imported_content.md for a list of what I took, and [1] for what is
available.

Hi,

I think it would help to have a blog for ocaml.org. Any chance we can add
this to the ocaml.org infrastructure? We could wordpress.com. I think they
allow using a custom URL, so we could host there but still serve the blog
from blog.ocaml.org.

I just checked and ocaml.wordpress.com is already taken. Does anybody know
by who?

One may do that.  The more I think about it, the less I am convinced
that it is good to have the code in separate files.

For the French version at least, I was planning to ask the Faculty of
Translation and Interpretation to do the job ? each year, they are
looking for some real documents to be translated by their students.
This is likely to be for next year though.

Also, some tutorials were translated to other languages.  It is a
shame to loose these efforts IMHO.

For the short term, one could remove the links to other language
pages.  I think it is a bit premature to remove them from the
repository.

It would be easier from a deployment perspective to have something that outputs static HTML.  Would a Jekyll [1] configuration be better?

Hi Maxence,

Only the ?ml:content="ocaml noeval"?, the other one is inherited from
the HTML of the tutorials.  You can remove the ?noeval? if you wan the
code to be evaluated in the toplevel.

Not for know.

There was a couple of days ago but I removed if ? it enabled to select
lines but it was considered too brittle.

Not for now.  One of the original goal of weberizer was to be HTML
compatible so that visual tools can be used to edit the file without
messing the code.  Now, the build runs a function of type html ? html
on all files so that is easy enough to do rewriting if we want to.  I
wonder though if it is not better then to pursue the idea further and
allow (part of) the documents to be written in an extensible WIKI
syntax (the extension would for example make possible to define
buttons).  Not sure which way to go yet.

Best,
C.

JWIY, this is the way we are using CoW (for openmirage.org, www.ocamlpro.com and opam.ocamlpro.com for instance). Most of the content is written in (github) markdown and that works fairly well - which also means the contents is editable using the github user-friendly interface. The only custom extension of markdown that we are sometimes using is a way to add div section in the document, which help formatting the output.

Probably Maxence meant including entire files, which would be easy enough.
The brittle-ness arose from specifying specific lines within a file to
include, which would get out of sync whenever you modified the file.

We should start a document on the wiki, where we start listing the possible
implementation techniques and their pros and cons.

Going this route, we could probably do something ourselves and avoid the
extra dependency. We're also thinking about supporting wiki syntax for a
subset of the content, so we'll consider all these points collectively.
I'll start a wiki page to layout the implementation choices.

What would be the intended content for the blog?  Would it be for site
related announcements?  Would it be a central place to share ocaml
thoughts, such as the science based medicine blog that has a single blog
but multiple authors.

Mainly I wanted it because there are items that make sense to go on the
ocaml.org website, but which become slowly less relevant over time. It's
awkward to keep these as normal html files. A few examples:

* Serious Contender page [1]. It's nice, but where to put it? It would be
perfect as a blog post (backdated in this case) because it was relevant at
the time the page was made, and we don't want to claim this as a recent
news item (since the information in it is old).

[1] https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/34


* Success Stories [2] might make more sense as blog posts. Some of the
current ones are kind of outdated. Making each of these a blog post would
automatically make them less relevant over time (and presumably we'll have
new success stories being added over the years). The current page could be
a filter on blog posts tagged "Success Story".

[2] http://ocaml.org/success.html


* Semi-official announcements, e.g.
- a new release of OCaml (but this would overlap with Inria's blog, so
should be coordinated with them)
- "Real World OCaml in print". This would be a result of wide spread
importance to the community.

I think it should be limited in use. Opening it up more widely seems
unnecessary. You can easily make your own blog, and subscribe it to the
Planet.

You're right, the Serious Contender stuff doesn't need to be on an official
site like ocaml.org. I think Success Stories can still make sense. Over
time they might get more detailed and become white papers, which even the
most successful businesses release. But certainly, we shouldn't appear
desperate, which we're not.  :)


If something is important then it should have its own page


An OCaml release or a new book being published are important but don't make
sense as a whole page. I suppose each of these items could be on some other
blog and thus show up on the Planet. I guess I'm looking for a way to
filter out a subset of all Planet items that are worth displaying more
prominently on the frontpage, or other pages within ocaml.org.
(Incidentally, the current frontpage design doesn't support this.)

The site is owned by the community, so there is no such thing as "others".
Question is just if it makes sense to include it. A tutorial on any general
topic would almost surely fit. A tutorial on a very specific topic (e.g.
how to use a library only used by a few people) might not.

Exactly. I encountered the same questions in stog. Another idea would
be to read a whole file with the toplevel and access the environment to
be able to get the location of the code for a given value id, for
example. Or use an ocamldoc dump to insert only some values or types.
But the first need was indeed to include a whole file.

I would love to publish Alan Schmitt's weekly news through it so its available via RSS. Add on an "OPAM updates of the week too".

For information, stog was originally designed to be a static blog
generator, with ability to display evaluated ocaml code. See these two
posts:

  http://zoggy.github.com/stog/posts/displaying-evaluated-ocaml-code.html
  http://zoggy.github.com/stog/posts/ocaml-sessions.html

and an example of big document with lots of evaluated ocaml code, that
is the code is verified at generation time:

  http://form-ocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org/intro_ocaml.html

I think that both those examples would be better posted on someone's blog 
and fed through the Planet. And I think the same could probably be said of 
anything that might go on blog.ocaml.org.

If something is important then it should have its own page, but if it is 
just something interesting that you would like to share with people then it 
is probably better to put it on a personal blog.

Just my two cents.

Regards,

Leo

P.S. I also think that those kind of "see, people do use our language" 
pages seem a bit desparate on an official website. You don't see a "Python 
success stories" page on www.python.org.

Python not having success stories on it's front page is fairly new. They
had that NASA thing on their for ages.

FWIW, I think success stories are fine, I just ignore them.

I had another look, and python.org does indeed have a success stories page. 
And so does ruby-lang.org. So clearly its just me who doesn't like them :)

That is what I was thinking. Although I suppose it might also work to give 
major announcements their own pages hidden away somewhere (perhaps in a 
subdirectory of wherever the Planet stuff ends up) and then push them 
through the Planet system.

>(Incidentally, the current frontpage design doesn't support this.)

Some method of filtering out and highlighting important news is probably 
something that we need to figure out anyway. Ideally they should appear 
more prominately and age more slowly than regular blog posts.

I'm wondering if ocaml.org is willing to host some ocaml related content
produced by others?

I don't have anything yet but I'm thinking of things like tutorials that
don't make sense as a blog post but one may not want to host themselves.

Does "infrastructure" include discussions about content, design, whether
the frontpage should have another box on the right below the other two or
in the middle, ...? Just making sure you want all that kind of discussion
on this list. If so, it's okay with me to merge them. Christophe?

Very useful; I'll move infrastructure information on here as well (it's
currently in ad-hoc Markdown files on the OCaml Labs www).

I reckon putting all this discussion on this list is most useful...if you
want, I can inject old mbox archives into this list to merge them.

Dear ocamlweb-devel subscribers,

OCaml Labs is hosting a new mailing list to discuss all matters related to
the ocaml.org project. Thus we are retiring this one.

Please subscribe to the new list by going here:

http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure

I'll disable this list soon, and we should be able to migrate messages from
this list to the new one.

Best,
Ashish

Yes, absolutely. Ultimately, everything done on the infrastructure has to be reflected on the website somehow, so these discussions all need to fit together.

For instance, OPAM will have a website and regular feed of package updates too, and this needs to be woven into the front page somehow.  But too many of those boxes will be very busy, so it'll be useful to get all this discussion on one list.

On second thought, maybe including even tutorials on niche topics is okay.
It's just a matter of organizing the content, and we could simply have a
section for "Tutorials on Specialized Topics". The benefit is we save
people the hassle of creating a blog or setting up a website just to write
a small amount of content.

Just a URL to it (the raw mbox) would be enough, and I can do the shell-fu on the lists.ocaml.org end

I think the community benefits from the content being centralized and
authors as well. Looking forward to producing something to share!

Hi, yes porting the ocaml-tutorial.org content was one of our first big
tasks. We didn't port all the non-English versions of the tutorials, but
did take every tutorial in English. Sylvain, it was very good you had this
mirror!

Hi,

Note that there is:
http://mirror.ocamlcore.org/ocaml-tutorial.org/index.html

Which is willing to be rehosted elsewhere (this was just a backup before
cocan went down). I think it should be nice to copy/paste content from here
to another wiki.

Thanks Bob! This could be a nice addition. Probably the best way is to
leave it as a separate project since you already have a nice coherent
document. If we start picking out pieces, the content will get fragmented
and be harder to keep in sync with your updates. It might be nice to
publish the contents on ocaml.org, preferably in html format. I'll open an
Issue for this so we keep track of the idea.

This is great. And some of you may remember a certain page, which I won't
name, but was negative about OCaml, that used to annoyingly come out on the
first page. It's way down the list now. A few days ago I checked and had to
go to the 18th page of results before it showed up.

We have a google account "ocamlwebsite" dedicated for official
ocaml.orgpurposes [1]. We should use it for all google products like
youtube,
analytics, etc.

Comes up 2nd for me, right after the wikipedia page (3rd if you count the Jane Street add at the top).
4th-7th are INRIA sites, 8th is Jane Street's OCaml page, 9th is the OCaml Labs homepage and 10th is Planet OCaml.

Also, google.com redirects me to google.co.uk (seems I can't choose anymore).

Traffic stats would be interesting but even more so would be how people currently find their way to ocaml.org and which pages they land on.  I'm curious to know the ratio of direct visits (typing ocaml.org into the browser) vs  people who follow links.  Of those that follow links, who are the referrers.

We have set-up google analytics for ocaml.org, I'm happy to give access to the stats to anyone interested (I don't know if it's easy to export the data).

Hi,

Just want to drop a mail to say that ocaml.org is now on first page
http://www.google.com/#q=ocaml

It is the 4th entry after caml.inria.fr and wikipedia.

This is VERY good (never achieved this with the forge). It is the same for
bing.

Ashish do you have some Google Analytics setup to track the number of
visitors ? I would be very interested to see the traffic.

Regards
Sylvain

Hi Sylvain,

Very good news indeed!

We do have some analytics on the website. For the past month, there were
approximatively 3000 visitors!

BTW, I am planning to setup analytics as well to forge.(SOON TO BE).
ocaml.org and planet.ocaml.org, maybe it makes sense to have all this stats
in one place (i.e. the analytics account where ocaml.org is already hosted).

When using google.fr, ocaml.org doesn't appear to come out on top. Only on google.{com/.co.uk} for me.

I'd be wary of drawing too many conclusion from this just yet.  There's no testing going on regarding intent so those could be anything from casual drive-by visitors to hard-core users.  All we can say is that 1/3rd of visitors to the ocaml.org site are using Windows.  

Also bear in mind that stats like this might be skewed by population size.  It doesn't surprise me at all that there are a lot of US visitors.  Having said that, I don't know what Google Analytics does in the background to mitigate this (if at all).

Anecdote: One of the things a startup friend told me is that when your browser visits start matching the ratio of overall browser market share, then you can consider yourself as breaking out of the 'echo-chamber'.  This used to mean going from Firefox-heavy traffic to IE-heavy traffic (Chrome may have changed things since then).

Just had a quick look at the stats, and there are some surprises....

Top OS: Windows (33%), then Linux and Mac...
Top social referrer: Twitter, then Stack Overflow and G+.
Country: US (27%), France (12%)

Here are the fact I am surprised about:
- people seems to think that the OCaml community is UNIX centric... seems
to be not that true (at least 1/3 are not using UNIX based system)
- I was expecting to see reddit in the top social referrer and G+ far
below.... this is not the case
- I was expecting to see at least France in top position here.

Overall I am surprised by this stats. I think we should take another look
in 6 months.

That can explain the lack of French users. There is room for improvement
but it is on the right track...

 I'm curious to know the ratio of direct visits (typing ocaml.org into the
browser) vs  people who follow links.  Of those that follow links, who are
the referrers.

I want to add, that google might customise the search to according to
various properties of the client. Currently on my machine at home (now)
ocaml.org is winning - strangely at work it was as reported just after
the wikipedia article but no longer as for today. (google.com -> google.co.uk).

An interesting comparison would be to how many visitors caml.inria.fr used
to get vs what ocaml.org is getting. The Inria site has statistics
somewhere, but I can't find them now.

Amir, Sylvain, do you have access to the ocamlwebsite account? How are you
seeing the statistics otherwise? It might be good for us to make the
analytics public, if google allows that.

The configuration also still refers to ocaml-lang.org. I'll see if that can
be updated.

Well, guessing intent from stats is kind of hard. I mean, you CANNOT do
that even after a long period of time. All these are just clues, you must
make guess on the stats.

I would be deeply surprised that we got a lot of "drive-by visitors"... You
cannot really end up on the front page of ocaml.org just as you will end-up
on a Facebook page. The ocaml.org website doesn't really have catch all
words/sentences.

What do you want to mitigate ? If there are a lot of US visitors, you won't
divide the number of US visitors...

That probably stands for general purpose web sites -- which is not the case
of ocaml.org.

I would say that what is important is the number of abandonment ("sorties"
in french) from the root page. In the case of "ocaml.org", 34% abandon from
/, 21% goes to install, 14% goes to taste.html... I guess it shows that we
have a lot of people interested enough to discover how to install OCaml...
I think there is a clear intent to discover the OCaml language when going
to ocaml.org.

Perhaps I shouldn't call them 'drive-by', so how about 'first-time, unique'? I didn't mean to suggest these are people who got there by accident, but that they were simply 'having a quick look'.  ~60% of the words that people put into google before arriving at the site are unknown to us ("Keyword not provided") so we don't necessarily know how people find their way there.

I don't want to mitigate.  I wasn't sure if we're seeing the raw numbers or the numbers after some behind-the-scenes google manipulations (which I doubt in this case). See also search trends [1], which indicates that over the last 90 days, France is doing the most searching for 'OCaml'.  I've no idea how google works this out and whether they account for overall search volume somehow.

Why shouldn't a programming language website (ultimately) have a broad set of visitors? You've already pointed out the large number of Windows visitors so I don't think it's a stretch to consider this a general purpose website (in time).  Those figures are related to the OSes people browse from, which are not necessarily where they do their OCaml hacking.

I'd be curious to know what the figures look like for Haskell.org (I've sent an email so will let folks know if/when I hear back).

> I would say that what is important is the number of abandonment ("sorties" in french) from the root page.

I think there is a clear intent to discover the OCaml language when going to ocaml.org.

Curious to know where you're looking for these figures.  I can see different pages that state 34% exit rate from root and also 54% exit rate from root.  I don't see the ones that indicate e.g "21% go to install" so where should I be looking?

Journeys from the root page are useful but be wary of how we interpret them.  e.g if it's a great page and 90% of the visitors find exactly the information they wanted and _leave_ then we have an exit rate of 90%.  If the page is terrible and 90% of people are frustrated and leave we _still_ have an exit rate of 90%.  It's a silly example but I hope it makes the point.

We should also expect people to land directly on pages from search results (not every journey starts from root).  "OCaml Install" as a search term has 3 INRIA pages and ocaml.org/install as 4th.  "ocaml tutorial" sends me to mirror.ocaml.org (top result), with ocaml.org/tutorial as 3rd.  As more content is tweaked and back-links created, I expect the relevant ocaml.org pages to rank higher.  My point is that landing pages are just as important as how people navigate the site and (imho) the search terms are more indicative of what people were looking for.  

Best wishes,
Amir

Subject: [ocaml-infra] google analytics configuration
Message-ID: <CAMu2m2JsbQ4dA2B9pF4nCRzB_K_=8mQ+Dn8qCXU4yaXgg1E=jg@mail.gmail.com>

I just browsed the google analytics documentation, and their data model and
terminology is rather confusing. I see now that Thomas setup tracking on
the "ocamlpro" account (account, as in a google analytics account, which is
a different thing than a google account).

What we'd like is to move the ocaml.org "property" (property as in an asset
you own not a feature of something, so the ocaml.org website has been
defined as a property that exists, under the ocamlpro account) to another
account. Amazingly, it seems that Google Analytics has no feature for
moving a property from one account to another!

Thomas must have granted read-only access to some of us, which is why we
can see the stats.

As far as I can tell, there are only two solutions:

1) If the ocamlpro google analytics account contains only the
ocaml.orgproperty (I doubt it, but Thomas please confirm), then we got
lucky. Thomas
you can give admin access to ocamlwebsite at gmail.com, the name ocamlpro can
be changed, and everything will be as we want it.

2) We re-define the ocaml.org property under a new account, and start
tracking with the ID for this new property. Unfortunately, we then lose the
history in the current property. I'll set this up and get it going, and for
now let the tracking happen under both (which I hope isn't a problem).

Advice: if you ever use google analytics, be sure to create a distinct
google analytics account for each website you want to track (all this can
go under a single google account, so you still don't have too many actual
accounts). I have no idea what the utility of a google analytics account
is. The concept seems superfluous.

OK, on "first time, unique" (better than drive-by in my mind). Although, I
would consider them as the target of of ocaml.org (i.e. a way to publicize
more OCaml). So having a lot of "first time, unique" is a good thing.

Why Google would change any numbers?

Anyway, I can tell you that some stuff are filtered out:
- browser without JavaScript
- robots

But, you expect this people to be filtered out.

Concerning France, I 100% agree on the fact that there is a problem here. I
don't have any clear explanation/hyptothesis on this topic.

Here:
https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&pli=1#report/content-pages/a22552764w54925729p55893860/%3F_r.tabId%3Dnavigationsummary/

Contenu -> Toutes les pages -> Recapitulatif de navigation

There is an even better way to see it, but there is a problem that should
be fixed about the account configuration:
https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&pli=1#report/inpage/a22552764w54925729p55893860/

I am not sure to understand what you expect but I am pretty sure you won't
find the answer to questions like "exit rate is high because people find
the info" or "exit rate is high because people don't like the page" in the
stats. You can run a poll, but you'll have another bias in the population
that reply.

So whatever, a high rank in Google is by itself an achievement and the
number of people that visit the site is high. This is good and I think the
ocaml.org team is achieving its goal.

Hop, hop:

*.ocamlcore.org:
http://www.ocamlcore.org/statistics/
Although, I think the fact that everything is behind a reverse proxy screw
up a little bit the stats (all website have exactly 2 visitors each month
that is one of the reason I would like to use analytics rather than
awstats).

ocamlwebsite account?
Not sure, it is labelled "ocamlpro" for me and I have no access to
ocamlwebsite.

Hi,

indeed, it's what I've done

unfortunately we are tracking other websites as well ... I've tried to play a little bit with admin access and account migration but this seems completely broken. I don't understand why google can't fix this. I'll look tomorrow if I can find a free or open-source solution and import ocaml.org data in there.

> Advice: if you ever use google analytics, be sure to create a distinct google analytics account for each website you want to track (all this can go under a single google account, so you still don't have too many actual accounts). I have no idea what the utility of a google analytics account is. The concept seems superfluous.

Agreed, something that I learned in the hard way ...

FWIW, I have been using piwik for about 6 months and I am quite happy
with it.  For this we would need a server though ? maybe Anil can tell
in how much time the infrastructure will be ready?

I'm confused.  Why can't we give Administrator access to *only* the ocaml.org tracking to ocamlwebsite at gmail.com?

From the home page try this:
ocamlpro -> ocaml.org -> Admin (near the top right of the screen) -> Users (+ New User) ? and set the role to Administrator (i.e it's the same thing you did previously but with admin rights this time -- here for others who may be struggling with GAs confusing interface).

This only exposes the ocaml.org tracking and nothing else within the overall GoogleID (e.g I'm tracking about 6 sites under my gmail ID and some of them are shared some not).  Thomas, you can test this with other folks in OCamlPro to confirm the behaviour first.

I'm reluctant to change things around too much right now so I think we should stick with Google Analytics, rather than looking at other options we'd have to deploy ourselves.  If the fact that the tracking lives under OCamlPro's overall google ID is a problem (even after sharing admin access) then I'd simply replace/add tracking codes with one created under ocamlwebsite at gmail.com and accept the break in history [1].  We can consider a different (open source) set up later this year once we have infrastructure (and fixed any issues regarding uptime).  Even then, I'd keep GA tracking as a backup.

>> Advice: if you ever use google analytics, be sure to create a distinct google analytics account for each website you want to track (all this can go under a single google account, so you still don't have too many actual accounts). I have no idea what the utility of a google analytics account is. The concept seems superfluous.

> Agreed, something that I learned in the hard way ?

I dont understand what you mean by "create a distinct google analytics account for each website".  My last experience with GA is that it pretty much forces you to do this for each tracking code you create.  You can then share admin rights or add different users, independently of your other 'accounts'.  Am I wrong about this? I actually don't see how you could use GA any other way.

The last question on this page [2] might be worth a look (in time).

I've tried to do that but that give admin rights to ALL ocamlpro websites. I've also tried to create a new account, to give it the admin access, and then removed my account as a admin on ocaml.org: result I've lost all admin acces to all ocamlpro account, and the fresh account has admin access to all ocamlpro account. That's very bad.

I would advise you to double-check who has admin rights on your website then ...

You can track multiple website under each account, but then you can't migrate websites between accounts but the admin rights work at the account level, not the websites.

Hi,

The URL caml.org currently redirects to caml.inria.fr. Shouldn't it
redirect to ocaml.org ?

Cheers,

As far as I can tell, the hierarchy is:

Google Account

Google Analytics (GA) Account - an account that can be shared to multiple
Google Accounts

Property - multiple properties can be put under a GA Account

The problems:

1) You can give read only access to multiple Google Accounts on a per
property basis. But you can give admin access only to an entire GA Account,
giving the Google Account holder full rights to all Properties under that
GA Account.

2) You cannot move a Property from one GA Account to another.

Wow. So in effect it's possible to transfer *everything* but not individual sites.  Now I understand the problem better, thank you for explaining.  (I do find this really bizarre on the part of GA).

:) I went back to check for shared admin access and I don't have any (I spoke too soon).  However, I did use different email addresses/accounts (e.g admin at foo.com using Google Apps) to set up tracking IDs and then shared the data (not admin access) back to my own google ID.

Do you mean to publicize the groups? We've had some discussion [1] about a
User Groups page, which could be generalized to groups of all sorts,
perhaps split into different sections. Working groups could all be listed
here with a description and links to their mailing lists, etc. Actually,
this resolves the problem we were having that currently there are not
enough groups to justify a whole separate page.

This is going to be the first of several working groups (to be opened one at a time to avoid overload).  Others are wg-parallel (multicore/distributed programming), wg-build (build systems), and anything else proposed by the community.

The intention behind a working group is something that needs people across the community to work on, but that has a specific end goal when it can be wrapped up.  Each WG is chaired by a couple of people who can arbitrate as needed.

Therefore, platform and infrastructure won't be working groups: they are ongoing efforts.

Firstly, is there agreement on this approach, and secondly, what's the best way to reflect this on ocaml.org?

That's one's going to be fun :-)

It's not quite a user group though... it's more to get some reasonable consensus and well-thought out patches to propose upstream without lots of different opinions preventing anything from being merged.

I agree.  The blog posts can be easily filtered via keyword... just add wg:camlp4 to Leo's atom feed for example.

I think we should have a wg.ocaml.org or www.ocaml.org/wg. The second
option is the better because it allows to get a higher ranking through
backlinks (in term of SEO).

It should contains:
- links to the mailing list
- kind of "blog post" that can be posted to state the goal of the working
group, what are the progress made on the subject and at the end a
document/patch to wrap up
- the blog posts should be aggregated on planet.ocaml.org (to reach a wider
audience)
- if a workgroup is working on pacthes, there should be a "how to install"
webpages (e.g. OPAM + this patch against OCaml)

Although on the topic of working group, I think they should have
identifiable deliverables (patch, doc, library) and be limited in time.

Sylvain

So do you mean you'd rather not list the working groups on ocaml.org? Or
not in the place I suggested?

I think it would be nice that at least the discussions archives are 
publicly available so that one can have a feel of what is in store 
even if one does not have time to participate.  I'd personally would 
like to be involved in the camlp4 one (I really need extensions 
capabilities for one of my projects) and I am interested in 
wg-parallel but I do not think I'd have time to do anything serious 
in that group.

Best,
C.

Got it, so the working groups need much more content. The proposed groups
page would be just a list of groups and link to those groups' main sites
(e.g. meetup groups have their own pages on meetup, and working groups
could be linked to within ocaml.org).

I'd personally would like to be involved in the camlp4 one (I really need extensions capabilities for one of my projects) and I am interested in wg-parallel but I do not think I'd have time to do anything serious in that group.

Absolutely; the lists are already public and archived [1], but I've been asking the various chairs to think about how they'd like to summarise the discussions.  Let's just track this as it grows and tweak the website as necessary.

I'd definitely like to list them on ocaml.org, but I think they could use their own dedicated space somewhere.

One reason is to have a dedicated page per group is to aggregate blog activity around a particular topic, and rebuild them just as we do for the main blog RSS feed.  I was thinking that tagging a blog (e.g. like Leo's [1]) with wg:camlp4 should be enough to get it picked up and listed there.

Additionally the chairs might want to update it with recent activity and proposals.  This is particularly true for big ones like camlp4 that are going to take a while and require cross-cutting changes.

So...not particularly concrete thoughts, but at the same time, hiding it with the user groups probably isn't the right answer.  Amir, any thoughts on structure here?

That makes sense to me, and keeps the groups page reasonably populated too...

I concur.  Leo and I had a discussion about this kind of thing before the holidays, essentially revolving around the visibility of OCaml projects.  What we came up with was very similar to what you've described here, essentially 'project pages' which provide visibility and help members mark progress.  I think we'll revisit this as the working groups develop (as Leo's co-chairing one of the groups he'll have a much better idea of what will be useful).
