Hi,

We regularly announce OUPS related events on the ocaml mailing list,
and it turns out that this is not optimal. Some people are not reading
the mailing list and miss announcements, and some might be bothered by
the regular emails that are not interesting to them.

As a solution Gabriel proposed that we create an OUPS list on
lists.ocaml.org. Before commiting to that, I would like to know a bit
more about this (we have other options in mind that we need to
assess).

Best,
Thomas

Sure -- there's a similar one for cam-compiler-hacking as well on 
lists.ocaml.org.

Just give me a name, description, email addresses for admins, and I'll
create it on lists.ocaml.org.  You can use the usual Mailman interface
to manage it yourself after that.

OUPS is a Meetup group, which already supports a mailing list [1]. Why not
use that one?

I have received a few complaints about our use of meetup.com and it
appears that some people would be more confortable with a
"traditional" mailing list. At the moment, I use the caml-list as this
"traditional" mailing list for meetup.com averse people, which has
also a few issues. Hence my interest in lists.ocaml.org.

Hi Thomas, have your questions been answered? Should we set up the list?

Best wishes,
Amir

Subject: [ocaml-infra] opam installext packaged up
Message-ID: <B7505806-AA3B-4699-BFF2-4900C650825C@recoil.org>

Hi,

I've been cleaning up some of the bulk building infrastructure, and so have packaged up opam-installext into an OPAM package as Thomas Gazagnaire suggested a while back:

https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/3296

Testing and support for more OS distributions would be much appreciated.  When the pull request is merged, you just need to:

    opam update
    opam install opam-installext
    opam installext ssl

The configure script is pretty straightforward to edit in the source:

    https://github.com/avsm/opam-installext

If there are no objections, I will transfer this repository to the `ocaml` organisation on GitHub soon for a permanent home.

cheers,
Anil

Yep -- I just wanted to get all the hacky shell script and OS distro
detection stuff into a package first, since that will really benefit
from a wider contribution base.  I couldn't find anything out there
for doing distro detection from shell scripts -- does anyone know of
an existing tool to replace the `configure` script in opam-installext?

Nice! The next step is tighter integration with OPAM...
