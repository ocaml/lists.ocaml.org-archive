Working groups could all be listed here with a description and links to their mailing lists, etc. Actually, this resolves the problem we were having that currently there are not enough groups to justify a whole separate page.

I'd definitely like to list them on ocaml.org, but I think they could use their own dedicated space somewhere.

One reason is to have a dedicated page per group is to aggregate blog activity around a particular topic, and rebuild them just as we do for the main blog RSS feed.  I was thinking that tagging a blog (e.g. like Leo's [1]) with wg:camlp4 should be enough to get it picked up and listed there.

Additionally the chairs might want to update it with recent activity and proposals.  This is particularly true for big ones like camlp4 that are going to take a while and require cross-cutting changes.

So...not particularly concrete thoughts, but at the same time, hiding it with the user groups probably isn't the right answer.  Amir, any thoughts on structure here?
