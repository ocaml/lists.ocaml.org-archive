What would be the intended content for the blog?


Mainly I wanted it because there are items that make sense to go on the
ocaml.org website, but which become slowly less relevant over time. It's
awkward to keep these as normal html files. A few examples:

* Serious Contender page [1]. It's nice, but where to put it? It would be
perfect as a blog post (backdated in this case) because it was relevant at
the time the page was made, and we don't want to claim this as a recent
news item (since the information in it is old).

[1] <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/34">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/34</A>


* Success Stories [2] might make more sense as blog posts. Some of the
current ones are kind of outdated. Making each of these a blog post would
automatically make them less relevant over time (and presumably we'll have
new success stories being added over the years). The current page could be
a filter on blog posts tagged &quot;Success Story&quot;.

[2] <A HREF="http://ocaml.org/success.html">http://ocaml.org/success.html</A>


* Semi-official announcements, e.g.
- a new release of OCaml (but this would overlap with Inria's blog, so
should be coordinated with them)
- &quot;Real World OCaml in print&quot;. This would be a result of wide spread
importance to the community.

I think it should be limited in use. Opening it up more widely seems
unnecessary. You can easily make your own blog, and subscribe it to the
Planet.
