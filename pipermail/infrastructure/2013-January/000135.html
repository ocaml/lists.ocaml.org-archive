I concur.  Leo and I had a discussion about this kind of thing before the holidays, essentially revolving around the visibility of OCaml projects.  What we came up with was very similar to what you've described here, essentially 'project pages' which provide visibility and help members mark progress.  I think we'll revisit this as the working groups develop (as Leo's co-chairing one of the groups he'll have a much better idea of what will be useful).
