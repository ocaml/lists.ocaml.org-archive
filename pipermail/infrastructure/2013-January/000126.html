That's one's going to be fun :-)


&gt;<i> Firstly, is there agreement on this approach, and secondly, what's the best way to reflect this on ocaml.org?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean to publicize the groups? We've had some discussion [1] about a User Groups page, which could be generalized to groups of all sorts, perhaps split into different sections. Working groups could all be listed here with a description and links to their mailing lists, etc. Actually, this resolves the problem we were having that currently there are not enough groups to justify a whole separate page.
</I>
It's not quite a user group though... it's more to get some reasonable consensus and well-thought out patches to propose upstream without lots of different opinions preventing anything from being merged.
