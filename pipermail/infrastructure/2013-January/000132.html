</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Firstly, is there agreement on this approach, and secondly, what's the best way to reflect this on ocaml.org?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Do you mean to publicize the groups? We've had some discussion [1] about a User Groups page, which could be generalized to groups of all sorts, perhaps split into different sections. Working groups could all be listed here with a description and links to their mailing lists, etc. Actually, this resolves the problem we were having that currently there are not enough groups to justify a whole separate page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's not quite a user group though... it's more to get some reasonable consensus and well-thought out patches to propose upstream without lots of different opinions preventing anything from being merged.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be nice that at least the discussions archives are publicly available so that one can have a feel of what is in store even if one does not have time to participate.  I'd personally would like to be involved in the camlp4 one (I really need extensions capabilities for one of my projects) and I am interested in wg-parallel but I do not think I'd have time to do anything serious in that group.
</I>&gt;<i>

Absolutely; the lists are already public and archived [1], but I've been asking the various chairs to think about how they'd like to summarise the discussions.  Let's just track this as it grows and tweak the website as necessary.
