I think it would be nice that at least the discussions archives are 
publicly available so that one can have a feel of what is in store 
even if one does not have time to participate.  I'd personally would 
like to be involved in the camlp4 one (I really need extensions 
capabilities for one of my projects) and I am interested in 
wg-parallel but I do not think I'd have time to do anything serious 
in that group.

Best,
C.
