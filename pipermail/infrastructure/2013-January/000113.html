<PRE>I just browsed the google analytics documentation, and their data model and
terminology is rather confusing. I see now that Thomas setup tracking on
the &quot;ocamlpro&quot; account (account, as in a google analytics account, which is
a different thing than a google account).

What we'd like is to move the ocaml.org &quot;property&quot; (property as in an asset
you own not a feature of something, so the ocaml.org website has been
defined as a property that exists, under the ocamlpro account) to another
account. Amazingly, it seems that Google Analytics has no feature for
moving a property from one account to another!

Thomas must have granted read-only access to some of us, which is why we
can see the stats.

As far as I can tell, there are only two solutions:

1) If the ocamlpro google analytics account contains only the
ocaml.orgproperty (I doubt it, but Thomas please confirm), then we got
lucky. Thomas
you can give admin access to <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">ocamlwebsite at gmail.com</A>, the name ocamlpro can
be changed, and everything will be as we want it.

2) We re-define the ocaml.org property under a new account, and start
tracking with the ID for this new property. Unfortunately, we then lose the
history in the current property. I'll set this up and get it going, and for
now let the tracking happen under both (which I hope isn't a problem).

Advice: if you ever use google analytics, be sure to create a distinct
google analytics account for each website you want to track (all this can
go under a single google account, so you still don't have too many actual
accounts). I have no idea what the utility of a google analytics account
is. The concept seems superfluous.
