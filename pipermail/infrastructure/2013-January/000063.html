I have removed it.

One may do that.  The more I think about it, the less I am convinced
that it is good to have the code in separate files.

&gt;<i> But more generally, I'd like to ask whether multi-lingual support is

For the French version at least, I was planning to ask the Faculty of
Translation and Interpretation to do the job &#8212; each year, they are
looking for some real documents to be translated by their students.
This is likely to be for next year though.

Also, some tutorials were translated to other languages.  It is a
shame to loose these efforts IMHO.

For the short term, one could remove the links to other language
pages.  I think it is a bit premature to remove them from the
repository.

Best,
C.
