</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'd be wary of drawing too many conclusion from this just yet.  There's
</I>&gt;<i> no testing going on regarding intent so those could be anything from casual
</I>&gt;<i> drive-by visitors to hard-core users.  All we can say is that 1/3rd of
</I>&gt;<i> visitors to the ocaml.org site are using Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, guessing intent from stats is kind of hard. I mean, you CANNOT do
</I>&gt;<i> that even after a long period of time. All these are just clues, you must
</I>&gt;<i> make guess on the stats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would be deeply surprised that we got a lot of &quot;drive-by visitors&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot really end up on the front page of ocaml.org just as you will
</I>&gt;<i> end-up on a Facebook page. The ocaml.org website doesn't really have
</I>&gt;<i> catch all words/sentences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I shouldn't call them 'drive-by', so how about 'first-time,
</I>&gt;<i> unique'? I didn't mean to suggest these are people who got there by
</I>&gt;<i> accident, but that they were simply 'having a quick look'.  ~60% of the
</I>&gt;<i> words that people put into google before arriving at the site are unknown
</I>&gt;<i> to us (&quot;Keyword not provided&quot;) so we don't necessarily know how people find
</I>&gt;<i> their way there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside: I did some searching about this and found a blog post that was
</I>&gt;<i> enlightening:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/3798-Google-Analytics-Overcoming-Not-Provided-Keywords">http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/3798-Google-Analytics-Overcoming-Not-Provided-Keywords</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK, on &quot;first time, unique&quot; (better than drive-by in my mind). Although, I
would consider them as the target of of ocaml.org (i.e. a way to publicize
more OCaml). So having a lot of &quot;first time, unique&quot; is a good thing.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Also bear in mind that stats like this might be skewed by population
</I>&gt;<i> size.  It doesn't surprise me at all that there are a lot of US visitors.
</I>&gt;<i>  Having said that, I don't know what Google Analytics does in the
</I>&gt;<i> background to mitigate this (if at all).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you want to mitigate ? If there are a lot of US visitors, you
</I>&gt;<i> won't divide the number of US visitors&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to mitigate.  I wasn't sure if we're seeing the raw numbers
</I>&gt;<i> or the numbers after some behind-the-scenes google manipulations (which I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt in this case). See also search trends [1], which indicates that over
</I>&gt;<i> the last 90 days, France is doing the most searching for 'OCaml'.  I've no
</I>&gt;<i> idea how google works this out and whether they account for overall search
</I>&gt;<i> volume somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] <A HREF="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ocaml">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ocaml</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why Google would change any numbers?

Anyway, I can tell you that some stuff are filtered out:
- browser without JavaScript
- robots

But, you expect this people to be filtered out.

Concerning France, I 100% agree on the fact that there is a problem here. I
don't have any clear explanation/hyptothesis on this topic.


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anecdote: One of the things a startup friend told me is that when your
</I>&gt;<i> browser visits start matching the ratio of overall browser market share,
</I>&gt;<i> then you can consider yourself as breaking out of the 'echo-chamber'.  This
</I>&gt;<i> used to mean going from Firefox-heavy traffic to IE-heavy traffic (Chrome
</I>&gt;<i> may have changed things since then).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That probably stands for general purpose web sites -- which is not the
</I>&gt;<i> case of ocaml.org.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why shouldn't a programming language website (ultimately) have a broad set
</I>&gt;<i> of visitors? You've already pointed out the large number of Windows
</I>&gt;<i> visitors so I don't think it's a stretch to consider this a general purpose
</I>&gt;<i> website (in time).  Those figures are related to the OSes people browse
</I>&gt;<i> from, which are not necessarily where they do their OCaml hacking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be curious to know what the figures look like for Haskell.org (I've
</I>&gt;<i> sent an email so will let folks know if/when I hear back).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

;-)

That a nice wish. Let see what are the haskell number.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would say that what is important is the number of abandonment
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;sorties&quot; in french) from the root page. In the case of &quot;ocaml.org&quot;, 34%
</I>&gt;<i> abandon from /, 21% goes to install, 14% goes to taste.html... I guess it
</I>&gt;<i> shows that we have a lot of people interested enough to discover how to
</I>&gt;<i> install OCaml... I think there is a clear intent to discover the OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> language when going to ocaml.org.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Curious to know where you're looking for these figures.  I can see
</I>&gt;<i> different pages that state 34% exit rate from root and also 54% exit rate
</I>&gt;<i> from root.  I don't see the ones that indicate e.g &quot;21% go to install&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> where should I be looking?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Here:
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&amp;pli=1#report/content-pages/a22552764w54925729p55893860/%3F_r.tabId%3Dnavigationsummary/">https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&amp;pli=1#report/content-pages/a22552764w54925729p55893860/%3F_r.tabId%3Dnavigationsummary/</A>

Contenu -&gt; Toutes les pages -&gt; Recapitulatif de navigation

There is an even better way to see it, but there is a problem that should
be fixed about the account configuration:
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&amp;pli=1#report/inpage/a22552764w54925729p55893860/">https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=fr&amp;pli=1#report/inpage/a22552764w54925729p55893860/</A>


&gt;<i> Journeys from the root page are useful but be wary of how we interpret
</I>&gt;<i> them.  e.g if it's a great page and 90% of the visitors find exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> information they wanted and _leave_ then we have an exit rate of 90%.  If
</I>&gt;<i> the page is terrible and 90% of people are frustrated and leave we _still_
</I>&gt;<i> have an exit rate of 90%.  It's a silly example but I hope it makes the
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should also expect people to land directly on pages from search results
</I>&gt;<i> (not every journey starts from root).  &quot;OCaml Install&quot; as a search term has
</I>&gt;<i> 3 INRIA pages and ocaml.org/install as 4th.  &quot;ocaml tutorial&quot; sends me to
</I>&gt;<i> mirror.ocaml.org (top result), with ocaml.org/tutorial as 3rd.  As more
</I>&gt;<i> content is tweaked and back-links created, I expect the relevant ocaml.orgpages to rank higher.  My point is that landing pages are just as important
</I>&gt;<i> as how people navigate the site and (imho) the search terms are more
</I>&gt;<i> indicative of what people were looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not sure to understand what you expect but I am pretty sure you won't
find the answer to questions like &quot;exit rate is high because people find
the info&quot; or &quot;exit rate is high because people don't like the page&quot; in the
stats. You can run a poll, but you'll have another bias in the population
that reply.

So whatever, a high rank in Google is by itself an achievement and the
number of people that visit the site is high. This is good and I think the
ocaml.org team is achieving its goal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Just had a quick look at the stats, and there are some surprises....

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Here are the fact I am surprised about:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - people seems to think that the OCaml community is UNIX centric...
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be not that true (at least 1/3 are not using UNIX based system)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - I was expecting to see reddit in the top social referrer and G+ far

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - I was expecting to see at least France in top position here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Overall I am surprised by this stats. I think we should take another

</I>&gt;<i> ocaml.org and planet.ocaml.org, maybe it makes sense to have all this

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Comes up 2nd for me, right after the wikipedia page (3rd if you
</I>&gt;<i> count the Jane Street add at the top).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 4th-7th are INRIA sites, 8th is Jane Street's OCaml page, 9th is the
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml Labs homepage and 10th is Planet OCaml.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, google.com redirects me to google.co.uk (seems I can't choose

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Traffic stats would be interesting but even more so would be how
</I>&gt;<i> people currently find their way to ocaml.org and which pages they land
</I>&gt;<i> on.  I'm curious to know the ratio of direct visits (typing ocaml.orginto the browser) vs  people who follow links.  Of those that follow links,
</I>&gt;<i> who are the referrers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We have set-up google analytics for ocaml.org, I'm happy to give
</I>&gt;<i> access to the stats to anyone interested (I don't know if it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> export the data).
