You're right, the Serious Contender stuff doesn't need to be on an official
site like ocaml.org. I think Success Stories can still make sense. Over
time they might get more detailed and become white papers, which even the
most successful businesses release. But certainly, we shouldn't appear
desperate, which we're not.  :)


If something is important then it should have its own page


An OCaml release or a new book being published are important but don't make
sense as a whole page. I suppose each of these items could be on some other
blog and thus show up on the Planet. I guess I'm looking for a way to
filter out a subset of all Planet items that are worth displaying more
prominently on the frontpage, or other pages within ocaml.org.
(Incidentally, the current frontpage design doesn't support this.)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time the page was made, and we don't want to claim this as a recent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> news item (since the information in it is old).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1] <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/**ocaml.org/issues/34&lt;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/34">https://github.com/ocaml/**ocaml.org/issues/34&lt;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/34</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Success Stories [2] might make more sense as blog posts. Some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current ones are kind of outdated. Making each of these a blog post would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically make them less relevant over time (and presumably we'll have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new success stories being added over the years). The current page could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a filter on blog posts tagged &quot;Success Story&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [2] <A HREF="http://ocaml.org/success.html">http://ocaml.org/success.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Semi-official announcements, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a new release of OCaml (but this would overlap with Inria's blog, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be coordinated with them)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - &quot;Real World OCaml in print&quot;. This would be a result of wide spread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance to the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it should be limited in use. Opening it up more widely seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unnecessary. You can easily make your own blog, and subscribe it to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Planet.
