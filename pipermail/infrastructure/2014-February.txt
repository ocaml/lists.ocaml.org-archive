I've created a small script here that generates compiler entries for each GitHub PR.  This makes it exceedingly easy to play around with new pull requests.

https://github.com/avsm/opam-sync-github-prs

I can publish this regularly as a custom remote, but it occurs to me that during the 6-month GitHub experiment, we may as well merge this directly into OPAM stable.  Most users will not see all the extra repositories due to requiring the --all script.

Any thoughts, objections or improvements?  I decided not to include closed pull requests in the generation, but that can easily be tweaked.

I have a small (shell) script myself that I use on top of OPAM,
  https://github.com/gasche/opam-compiler-conf

As an alternative to merging yours upstream, would it make sense to
think of a way to centralize those shell scripts and make them more
easily available to the user, a bit like "git contribs"?

Why don't you just submit the script as an OPAM package?  Then
"opam install compiler-conf" would give access to the
"opam compiler-conf" subcommand.

This seems orthogonal to regularly merging in switches based on
PRs, as those will be available via "opam update" very easily for
any interested user.

That's awesome!!!

I think that's a great idea, but would be nice to automatically remove closed PRs though if we do this.

Also, not sure how to handle the PR which adds / modifies the configure options, but we could fix that later.

Does seem very useful and an easy way for package maintainers to see how proposed patches might affect them..

Naiive question (since I haven't tried this myself): Does the switch grab the latest trunk version and apply the patch or does it take 4.01.0 and apply it?  I notice that the PRs are all for trunk.

I guess what I'm curious about is whether different people will end up with different things depending on when they do the switch.  i.e if trunk has advanced in the meantime.

Best wishes,
Amir

The compiler version is a command-line option:

   https://github.com/avsm/opam-sync-github-prs/blob/88a403eb8/generate.ml#L63

I wonder whether it'd be more reliable to use the source branch in the
pull request as the 'src' for the switch.  For example, for #6,
instead of generating

    src: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.0.2.tar.gz
    patches: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/6.diff

we might simply have

   src: https://github.com/hnrgrgr/ocaml/archive/type_constraint_warning.tar.gz

Right. Also note that you can refresh against the branch by running

$ opam switch reinstall 4.02.0dev+pr7

I did consider this, but there is a difference between the two.  With
the "fetch base branch + apply patch diff" approach, every installation
is rebasing against the current base branch (usually trunk).  With the
alternative you propose, it would be against the revision that the pull
request was opened against (as I believe that GitHub only includes the
fake merge commit upon merging, not upon fetching the archives).

Overall, I prefer the rebasing approach since it makes it obvious when
a PR fails against the latest branch it's intended for, and we don't want
to encourage un-rebased patches against trunk that don't merge anyway.

It could easily be made an option, but I'd prefer that we just pick one
approach for the regular cron-driven merges to the stable OPAM repo.

Dear all,

The content and implementation of the OCaml.org website do not have
licenses specified, which should be fixed. Our goal is to encourage
contributions, give appropriate credit to contributors, and maximize the
utility of the website for the entire OCaml community. We would like the
community's feedback on the following proposal:

(A) Content is released under CC BY-SA 4.0 [1].
(B) Code that implements the site is released under the ISC license [2].
(C) Code examples within content are released under the UNLICENSE [3].
(D) Design of the site. All rights reserved by the OCaml.org project.
(E) OCaml logo is released under the UNLICENSE [3].
(F) Abstracts, slides from meetings. Rights retained by contributor.

Here is our reasoning for each of the above:

(A) Content refers to text that is visible by readers at
http://ocaml.org(except for code; see (C) below). We'd like others to
be able to use these
materials but we don't want to create a situation where content that is
freely given to the community (which amounts to a substantive volume of
work) is then taken and monetized without giving back.

The CC BY-SA 4.0 license [1] allows anyone to share and adapt the work,
including for commercial gain, as long as that work is also released under
the same (or compatible) license. This means that commercial works could be
produced but free versions would also have to be made available. Thus, the
community wouldn't lose out on any derivative work.

(B) Code that implements ocaml.org. We want the code implementing the site
to be open source and available for others to use as they wish. Examples of
this include the files found under the 'script' folder of the repository
[6]. The ISC licence [2] has already been chosen for OMD and MPP, two
libraries that OCaml.org relies on substantially. Additional scripts are
not particularly complex in nature, and we feel their use should not be
restricted.

(C) Code examples within content. For example, you can see many of these on
the 99 problems page [5]. These are typically small pieces of useful code
and we want people to be able to use them however they see fit. We want to
do this without the burden of attribution that an open source license (e.g.
ISC) would require, so placing them in the public domain seems like the
sensible thing to do. The UNLICENSE [3] is one way of putting works in the
public domain and is how code examples in Real World OCaml are released [4].

(D) Design of the site. This is essentially the CSS, banner image, and
custom logos (except the OCaml logo, see (E) below). The design uniquely
identifies ocaml.org, and it would be awkward if another site looked
similar. It seems sensible to reserve all rights over the design and
disallow copying it in any form.

(E) The new OCaml logo [7], which you see in the top-left of ocaml.org,
should be encouraged. We hope this can be a unifying symbol of all things
related to OCaml. Everyone should use this logo in their OCaml blogs,
websites, documentation, presentations, T-shirts, stickers, etc. Thus, it
should be usable freely by all, which can be achieved by releasing it under
the UNLICENSE.

(F) OCaml.org also hosts abstracts and slides for various meetings, such as
the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop. Contributors should retain all
rights over those works or be subject to whatever agreement they have with
the respective meeting. They are not considered part of the Content as
defined in (A).

Ashish, thanks for sending this!

To all, In the interests of keeping things manageable, I'd be grateful if we could keep any discussions on the Infrastructure list (infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org).  It's public and archived [1] and we're happy to summarise the main points for the caml-list in due course.

Best wishes,
Amir

Thanks for summarising all of this Ashish.  I'm very happy with all of this, including the use of the UNLICENSE.  We've had no real issues with releasing the Real World OCaml examples under this license.

My only substantive comment is perhaps point D), regarding the copying of ocaml.org.  We should probably make it sufficiently permissive to allow people to build their own forks of ocaml.org, which would currently be forbidden under the terms described below.  Perhaps a clarification (somehow) or restriction (non-commercial use?) would suffice here without confusing matters too much.
 
best,
Anil

Very good move, thanks for doing this clarification !

However we do have a number of contents on ocaml.org ; we'll need to go through them and discuss their licensing internally to give a proper response.

Thanks,
Louis

Hi

About the new logo,

- I found this page: http://ocaml.org/docs/logos.html which still
references the "old" logos
- and, in the source there are 2 PNGs for the new one:
    -
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/site/img/ocaml-colour.png
(One day, we should converge on US Vs UK spelling BTW :) )
    -
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/site/img/ocaml-large.png

Is there somewhere a vector-version of the new logo? SVG or PDF?
(we were thinking of printing some ocaml laptop-stickers for the NYC-OCaml
meetup group)


Thanks&cheers
Seb

This page will be updated once we receive final versions of the new logo.
Not all variations of formats have yet been produced by the design firm.

Hi Sebastien,

You can see the final logo at: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos

You can also see previous iterations and links to where the discussions took place.  As Ashish says, the final step is to get all variations of logos (inc SVG) and then we can update the page you pointed to.  We'll also update the PNGs you mention as they're previous iterations.

Thanks,
Amir

I would suggest to replace by:
(A) Content is released under CC BY-SA version 4.0 or above

So that when the maintainers of the website want to upgrade the
CC-by-sa license to a newer version, they don't have to ask to all the
contributers.

> (B) Code that implements the site is released under the ISC license [2].
> (C) Code examples within content are released under the UNLICENSE [3].

I would suggest to replace the word "design" by "style guide" or
"style manual", because for French speaking people it's quite
ambiguous, and we don't know if "design" also include pieces of CSS
code that could be reused without any visual similarities.

Also what about people willing to just archive the website, like for
example every link on the French Wikipedia was a cached archive.

Another case, what about people willing to reuse the current "design"
of ocam.org far long time after ocaml.org doesn't use this current
visual style anymore? you know like all the fan website of nostalgics.
Currently copyright extends to 70 years, what don't just reduce it to
10 years after ocaml.org don't use this current visual style anymore?

> (E) OCaml logo is released under the UNLICENSE [3].

The UNLICENSE license is a licence for softwares.
A logo is not a software.
I would suggest to replace in the text of the UNLICENSE license the
word "software" by "piece of work" or something similar which would be
more relevant (the English language is not my born language, so please
correct this rewording if it should.)

It would be nice too if the rephrase "software" by "piece of work"
would also be made for licenses applying on the code, so that when
someone makes a piece of work that includes at the same time code,
graphics and music everything could be licensed under the same
conditions in an uniformly way which would not introduce
hierarchisation in the different kind of works.

Anyway very nice proposal,
good luck!

Hi,

  I have a few points that I would like to see clarified before:

1/ What is exactly "Ocaml.org" in this discussion ? Is opam.ocaml.org
included here, or not ? I think it would be clearer if the website was
called "www.ocaml.org", and this licensing policy only applied to that
site.

2/ Ashish said the goal was to "give appropriate credit to
contributors", but I couldn't find either a page listing the
contributors, nor an official copyright holder or just contributors
per page. As a consequence, I don't see who is the BY of CC BY-SA 4.0
[1].

By the way, in France, the site would be illegal, I think, as there is
no public entity (or individual) taking the responsibility for
potential illegal content on any page.

3/ I am concerned by the "governance" part of
http://ocaml.org/about.html . I don't think the 5 current members are
representative of the OCaml community, 3 of them are in the UK, 1 in
the US and 1 in Belgium. Given that the current rules gives them too
much power (each of them has the right to prevent anybody from joining
the group: I have never seen that anywhere else, I would actually
expect the contrary, that any member would have the right to add new
members), I think it is a barrier for adoption and contribution by the
wider community (especially the French one, see for example how
outdated the page http://ocaml.org/docs/install.fr.html is, latest
version is 4.00.1 there).

This is a good point.

I'd be inclined to go the other direction and include the opam.ocaml.org
content under the "*.ocaml.org" wing, since more clarity is better than
less.  In the case of opam.ocaml.org, there's much less original content
than the mainline ocaml.org.  As I see it, opam.ocaml.org has:

* The documentation on OPAM installation.
* The look-and-feel CSS (which will be folded into the ocaml.org one at
  some point)
* Tools such as opam2web generate the bulk of the content from the
  database, which already has a well-defined license.

So it's really just the first point that needs clarification.  Note that
some of the resources behind ocaml.org (such as the DNS and the SSL
certificates) cover all the sub-domains, so it makes sense to merge the
copyright handling as well.

I think this is going to keep cropping and causing problems, but it's
worth seeing how other languages deal with this.  Python.org is owned by
a registered foundation, but the Haskell.org wiki is simply released
under BSD-style: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellWiki:Copyrights

I'm not familiar with French law but would like to read up on it;
could you provide a pointer to why Haskell.org would be illegal in 
France (or is this only if it's *hosted* in France?).

It's important to note that the governance structure arises from the
people who participate and have done most of the work as volunteers
(particularly Ashish and Christophe).   That's why the first line is
"a small team of individuals volunteer their time to manage and develop
the site".  Note also that it says that "As the site and community
grows, a more formal governance structure may be required".

I agree that consensus is a rather strong form of governance, but it's
also not been a barrier so far.  I'd very much like to see ocaml.org
remove as many blockers to external contributors as possible, particularly
in the realm of translations.  To address your short-term concern
about diversity, would anyone from OCamlPro or INRIA Gallium be willing
to step into the team?

best,
Anil

The point is: is ocaml.org THEIR website, or the website of the
COMMUNITY ? If it is their website, it is clear that they should keep
the control of what they have done. But if it is the website of the
community, then the control should belong to the community, i.e. a
representative group of persons, and contributors should not have more
control, but just be credited for what they have done (this can be
done by adding a "credit" page, or  a hall-of-fame of contributors).

I think it has already been a barrier, but it was not noticed, just
because it is hard to see contributions that are not sent.
Contributing to a website is not the same as contributing to free
software. In the case of free software, you usually contribute by
something that is going to be useful to yourself first, and that can
then be useful to other people too. For a website, why would somebody
contribute ? In some way, if you plan to become an heavy contributor,
you need some insurance that you are giving your contribution to the
good place, that the website is the one of the community, and not just
yet another project of web portal for OCaml. For that, if the website
is not already attracting everybody, you are going to check that you
like the team driving the website, if you know them, if you like what
they usually do, if they are likely to like what you are going to
contribute, etc. So, I think it is important to have a much larger
team than the current team, maybe also with members who are not heavy
contributors, but who are famous in the community.

I already applied a few months ago. I can check around me at OCamlPro
and Gallium if there are other volunteers to contribute.

Dear all,

Please can I remind everyone that the discussion is about licensing. I appreciate that long-term governance is also an important consideration but it needs to be covered independently as it's a more complex issue.

At the moment we have many people contributing to the site and the new tooling has made it even easier to do so.  I'm sure everyone agrees that we need to resolve the issue of how the current and incoming content is licensed.  A constructive discussion on just this topic will help us reach a conclusion.  Once we've reached a conclusion, please be aware that there's still the practical matter of actually re-licencing the existing content.  

I'd be grateful if we could keep our discussions within the scope to ensure we keep moving forward.

Many thanks,
Amir

[As this is a licensing discussion, I'm only replying to those points. Any governance questions can and should be discussed separately, at a later date].

I agree that this is a good point.  I think it reduces complexity to consider everything under "*.ocaml.org" (as Anil mentions).  That's how I've been thinking of it so far but it's good to clarify.

Eventually, I expect most of the content under opam.ocaml.org to be automatically generated from the opam repository with the addition of documentation pages (i.e installation) and perhaps even a dashboard view of activity in the repo.  Since opam-repo content should already have license information it's only the additional content that would fall under the *.ocaml.org licensing scheme.  At the moment it's not clear how this is currently licensed as it's generated from the wiki pages [0], which are separate.  Clarification on this would be useful.

The question of *who* the contributors are is very straightforward as we have git logs of all activity [1].  You can even see this per page if you wish [2]. It is those contributors ('Licensors') who would be asked to license their contributions under the scheme proposed.

Even if we did have a legal entity behind the *.ocaml.org infrastructure and sites, I still believe the above is the correct way to deal with *volunteer* contributions.  They should not be obliged to relinquish all rights to a private third party.  Note that what I'm suggesting is the same as the Haskell wiki, except their scheme is to put everything in the public domain instead (it's still the case that no third party owns the contribution).  

Please be aware that speculative discussions about specific legal jurisdictions will not progress this discussion in any meaningful way.  There are approx 206 countries [3] and we do not have the resources or legal manpower to examine any of them in any great detail (just like every other volunteer project).  The licenses proposed are all commonly used so any issues that arise with them will affect a large number of other open-source projects.  We would not be alone in having to deal with any issues.  Indeed, we would benefit from the work other projects may do in this regard.

Hi Florent,  

Thanks for your comments.  My thoughts are inline.

I'm a little wary of this. I can see the benefit but I don't think maintainers should relicense without going back to contributors.  It may also introduce confusion if elements in future versions of the CC-BY-SA are not backward compatible.

I'm inclined to stick with just one version but I welcome other viewpoints on this.

Interesting point.  I've no objection to changing the wording but I'd like to hear from others about the reuse of CSS.  It seems fine to me but perhaps it might be more confusing to deal with.

I hadn't thought of these but I don't think we should worry about them too much.  The intent behind restricting use of the design is to reduce the likelihood of confusion with another site.  If we're no longer using it, then there won't really be anyone to object to a nostalgic fan website.

Yes, I think you're right.  The aim is to put the image in the public domain so changing the wording of the unlicense would probably be ok in this case (it would no longer be the 'unlicense' but that's fine).

I don't think we should alter the legal documents themselves.  We're using existing licenses because they're widespread and largely understood.  Tweaking those would be akin to forking them, which I think would have more negative effects for us than positive.  The only exception I see to this is the release of the OCaml logo into the public domain, as mentioned above.

Ok, so if we only focus on licensing, I would like to have licenses
attached to directories in the GIT directory, i.e. make it easy to
know which file is under which license. It is especially important for
point (D): whoever wants to customize its own version of the website
(for example, for a version of the website translated to another
language), but with a different design (with flags, for example :-) ),
should know immediatly the parts that shouldn't be used on the new
website, and have to be replaced.

Otherwise, I think we (OCamlPro) are good with the current licensing policy.

> The question of *who* the contributors are is very straightforward as we have git logs of all activity [1].  You can even see this per page if you wish [2].

I think contributors deserve a better place on the website than being
in a GIT log. Having a credit page listing all the contributors would
be enough. It would be easy for anybody that contributes to add his
own name to that page in the same pull-request as the content being
pushed.

About the governance, I do think you should not mix contributors and
governance, as currently done, for such a community website, but I
will keep my point for the corresponding discussion.

I agree with this.  Although it makes the source files uglier, I also
prefer having an explicit license per-file, since this eases copying
individual source modules into other projects.  (This doesn't apply to
documentation, just source code).

This will get out of date pretty fast, and also results in a lot of merge
conflicts if there are multiple outstanding requests.  I recommend just
autogenerating it using Thomas' Git implementation 
(http://github.com/samoht/ocaml-git).

Maybe we can even add the license as a couple of lines to the top of
each file (so it is immediately clear what it is if one presses the
"edit" button).  For example, for .md files, this could be

<!-- Content is under CC BY-SA 4.0, Code examples under UNLICENSE.
     See LICENSE.md for more details. -->

"headache" could do most of the work for us.

We also have not to forget the people? who contributed to the
tutorials and who do not appear in the Git log.  Also note that some
people appear several times with different names and some other use
abbreviations that may not be clear (e.g., "MM", "lehy", "mrnt0810").
For the git log, as long as the contribution is good, I do not care
much but for an acknowledgment page, it may look funny.

Best,
C.

Firstly, I agree that having license info at the top of each source file is better.  It becomes more clearly visible for people who are contributing solely via the web-based workflow (we've had a number of those now).  

Secondly, what's "headache"?

Finally, although this is not purely a licensing issue, I'm concerned about the comment "whoever wants to customize its own version of the website ?".  If this a reference about people (already) wanting to fork the site and maintain other versions then I'm quite concerned.  Licensing shouldn't prevent content re-use but this sounds like the opposite of building a community.

Provided it can be done in an automated manner, I don't mind having one page on the site, even if some of the names looks odd.   I'd mention at the top that it's generated from the git log and I wouldn't worry too much about people with different names.  I'm more keen on keeping things automated, even if they're not perfect.

To be more specific, I'd put the output of the following on a page (with additional text as above).
$ git log --format="%aN" | sort | uniq

I count about 50 or so contributors (allowing for duplicates).

Then, we should have both: headers in files for people contributing
through the web, and licenses in directories for people contributing
the Unix way.

It's a tool in OCaml to change automatically the headers of many files.

If this a reference about people (already) wanting to fork the site and maintain other versions then I'm quite concerned.

I don't see a link between preventing other people from creating their
variant of ocaml.org, and "buiding a community" (which I interpret as
"growing the OCaml community"). I would prefer having 10 major
websites about OCaml (one for OCaml under Windows, one for the Chinese
community, one for OCaml on mobiles, etc.), with 10,000 users behind
each one, than having just one website with 500 users, which would be
"the community website".

Whatever you will do, however good you are, you will always end up
with forks. I raised the problem of governance earlier, because I
think it is a good way to delay such forks. Also, in a pull-request
discussion, I suggested to use Wikipedia policy on moderation: allow
all modifications a priori, and then remove/change wrong quality
modifications a posteriori when they are discovered. This way,
contributors will have their content online fast, and are less likely
to fork to get their contribution online by themselves.

You might also want to have the equivalent of "Affero GPL" for
contents (I am not a specialist, but I imagine some CC licenses do
that): let people use the content of this site, but force them to
allow you to take back their contributions.

Indeed, it would be a very good thing.

In order to list the Batteries contributor on the slides of a talk, I
created a .mailmap file. Placing this in the root of the project will
let git know about duplicates and the "proper name" (and mail adress)
to use for any given person.

The format is documented in "git help shortlog", section MAPPING
AUTHORS. There are various variants, I only used "name <mail> name
<mail>", with the semantics of "whenever you see the stuff on the
right, count it as if it came from the person on the left". Relevant
quote with mail adresses blurred:

Philippe Veber <philippe.veber at ...> pveber <philippe.veber at ...>
Philippe Veber <philippe.veber at ...> Philippe <pveber at ...>
Eric Norige <thelema314 at ... thelema <thelema at ...>
David Teller <David.Teller at ...> Yoric <David.Teller at ...>
David Teller <David.Teller at ...> yoric <yoric at ...>

This is still a manual process, in the sense that I manually iterated
the process of running the author-listing command, then adding any
remaining duplicates / redundant nicknames to the .mailmap file. And I
guess this will need doing again in a few months/years, for the new
contributors that joined since.

Isn't this overkill?  I was thinking one LICENSE file in the root and the brief mention in the source.
What do others think? (apologies if I've misunderstood this part of the thread)

In the interests of staying focused, I'll withhold my thoughts on most of the above for a separate thread.

On a practical note, I will say that we have *dramatically decreased* the time taken from merging something to seeing it live on the site.  This was a conscious effort and content is usually live just a couple of minutes after merging.  Where features are being added/changed, it's reasonable to expect some discussion, as you would with any software project (note that no-one changes features on wikipedia - only content).

The ShareAlike component of the CC-BY-SA deals with this.  As you've already mentioned OCamlPro is ok with the scheme as proposed so I don't think we need to consider any other licenses.

There's now an issue to track this:

Thanks everyone for the many useful comments. We've reached consensus on
most points, but here are a few that remain:

In my opinion, forks should be discouraged. I agree with Fabrice that 10
websites on OCaml would be great, but not if they are forks of ocaml.org.
Different websites should be genuinely different.

I'm okay with this, and IIRC GPL has this encoded within the license
itself. Amir, you expressed the concern that newer versions of CC-BY-SA
might not be backwards compatible, making this complicated. However, I
doubt a license would be incompatible with its own previous versions.

In fact, we'll apply this license to specific text or images, so what it
applies to won't be ambiguous.

I'd rather ignore this issue. I think "fair use" rules may apply, which
would allow copying for certain reasons anyway. Also, it's very
hypothetical. Such permission can be granted when it is requested.
Similarly, I'd like to ignore the issue of using small parts of the CSS.
It's no one's intention to prevent that, but figuring out how to legally
allow it would be one extra complication. Again, I think "fair use" rules
might allow it anyway (I'm not sure).

I'm hesitant to modify licenses. Often, each little word has been thought
about by the license's authors, and it has real ramifications. Thus, should
we instead use CC0 for the OCaml logo?

We should probably make it sufficiently permissive to allow people to build their own forks of ocaml.org, which would currently be forbidden under the terms described below.  Perhaps a clarification (somehow) or restriction (non-commercial use?) would suffice here without confusing matters too much.

I concur.

Things do change within licenses and for one that's had as much consideration and development as the the CC licences, I'm really not keen on changing any of the wording.  Especially as they themselves keep each version separate.  We don't know what we might be opening ourselves up to nor for what benefit.  

Please note that backward compatibility is only one potential problem we may encounter.  It's not possible for me (nor anyone else) to enumerate *all* the potential downsides and it's not clear what the upside is either.  We'd get to use 5.0, then 6.0? Bear in mind that 4.0 would still also apply.

As you yourself say below, "each little word has been thought about by the license's authors, and it has real ramifications" ;) -- I know you're referring to the legal content of the license but I think it's just as applicable to how licenses are applied.

You can get a quick overview of changes between CC licenses from the link below.
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/License_versions

Perhaps I'm being overcautious here but I really don't see any upside to adding "or above" to the licensing scheme, whereas we give ourselves a bunch of "unknown unknowns" if we do.

Such permission can be granted when it is requested. Similarly, I'd like to ignore the issue of using small parts of the CSS. It's no one's intention to prevent that, but figuring out how to legally allow it would be one extra complication. Again, I think "fair use" rules might allow it anyway (I'm not sure).

To avoid doubt, I'm fine with either the modified UNLICENSE or CC0.  CC0 is probably 'fit-for-purpose' in this case.

The Unlicense itself is somewhat pieced together based on SQLite and the MIT no-warrantly [1].  It has it's critics but the intent is clear.  As such, each word has not really been thought about so I have very few concerns about changing one of them to make it broader (we'd *only* be applying it to the logo).  Having read far too much about licenses a few weeks ago, I decided that the most important thing was whether a well-intentioned human would understand the meaning (hence suggesting the Unlicense for code samples).

The CC0 [2] wasn't written specifically for software but it attempts to 'fall-back' in the case that putting something in the public domain isn't straightforward.  It's a lot more verbose than the unlicense but perhaps it's better in this case (for the logo).

If this a reference about people (already) wanting to fork the site and maintain other versions then I'm quite concerned.  Licensing shouldn't prevent content re-use but this sounds like the opposite of building a community.
