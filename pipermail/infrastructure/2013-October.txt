Hi,

As part of migrating the ocaml forge to ocaml.org, I would like to create a
fork of fusionforge running on the current forge in a github under the
ocaml.org account.

Is it ok to do so ?

Cheers
Sylvain

Sure; do you need a private account, or are the secure bits stored elsewhere?

The secure bits will be stored somewhere else, this is mainly to store
a pure fork of fusionforge and allow people to help me on the forge
maintenance (like creating a github plugin for it ;-). I will also
maybe create forge.o.o-tools for the various maintenance scripts (I
could create them in fusionforge but I would like to keep the
directory mergeable with the upstream).

Thanks a lot
Sylvain

Hi Florent, thanks for your comments.  

Anyone is very welcome to suggest changes or propose new ideas and I encourage this.  However, if you're referring to paid design work I should point out that we're already working with a professional design agency and have been since earlier this year [1].  The output of this work is posted up on the github wiki for ocaml.org [2] and on this mailing list (with the occasional post on the caml-list).  I've also started to blog more about it, which should find it's way into OCaml Planet (e.g the post I linked to previously).  

I've posted all the design options I have, so there aren't any other versions to look at.  I gave the agency a specific brief that the logo had to work in a square shape and have a bactrian camel.  If others are willing to make their ideas public then the best elements of those can still find their way into the final design (though I'd be wary of design by committee).  We're quite far into this process now and since you're the first person to mention it, I haven't had the impression this is something people wanted to do.

In any case, the end result is intended to be a new design for the ocaml.org site and a logo that is released to the community (probably under a creative commons licence, with svg files etc).  People will be able to modify it if they wish, though it would be great if people felt they could use the logo as is.

I hope the above answers your questions. Do you have specific comments on either the design or logo?  I'd love to hear them.

Best wishes,
Amir

Ashish, Christophe,

I'd like to start discussing how we migrate the existing ocaml.org to the new design and structure.  We do still have a lot of pieces to complete and Philippe has been collating a list of issues we need to deal with on the tracker [1].  It would be great if we can get your input on these and work out a plan to move the design over.  I'd really like to  get this done over the next couple of weeks.

My preference is to only deal with the site design and structure for the moment and leave new features (e.g packages/docs) until after the design is up.

Specific things to consider are that the new site uses markdown, based on the existing source html.  I'm expecting that we generate the markdown as we did for our fork and archive the current source files.  There is also the URL structure as I've moved many things into subfolders based on the navigation menu.  The URLs are based on this folder structure, which I hope makes it easier for people to mentally map the repo contents to the live site.  Philipe's also added an 'edit this page' link in the footer, which makes it easier for people to contribute quick fixes (it was something many people asked for and it works well but still needs some tweaks ).

Thoughts and comments are appreciated!

Hi Amir,
   Thanks for your hard work!
   I have a naive suggestion,   I prefer the original syntax coloring
for code  to the new one.

Thanks for the feedback Hongbo!
I've had a couple of other people say the same so we'll definitely have to revisit this.

I've captured it in an issue so we don't forget.

Amir,

If you feel the design work has stabilized enough to deploy it, we should
certainly port the current site. Let's chat offline about the various steps
required to do this.

> My preference is to only deal with the site design and structure for the
moment and leave new features (e.g packages/docs) until after the design is
up.

Agreed. Let's do one thing at a time.

Subject: [ocaml-infra] Setting up a host "infra.ocaml.org"
Message-ID: <CAOCAUGNtO-uNx-P1eAa2aTREh67nwLnE2o53E6SDVUdR=vyyOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

TL;DR I would like to create an isolated host infra.ocaml.org that
contains at least a Debian repository.

I am considering what need to be done to migrate and improve forge.o.o
(right now forge.ocamlcore.org, tomorrow forge.ocaml.org).

One of the thing that is "extremly" useful is to have a central,
secured hosts holding data repository for all other hosts. In my
current "home" installation, I have one host that contains for
examples my personnal Debian repository. This repository contains
Debian packages that need to be installed on every other hosts and I
use it to distribute home-made program accross all hosts using
standard Debian apt-get scheme, This may also contains some admin
panel/monitoring tools. The hosts is particular because it should be
extra protected against attack, since compromising this hosts can lead
to compromise all other hosts. In other words you should not use it
for public facing products.

Right now, the forge.o.o repository is hosted on the forge.o.o itself
(but it doesn't distribute data to any other hosts).

We may also use a private/public github account to store the
repository, if it makes more sense to you. But in this case, we will
need to figure how to GPG sign the release file.

Here are my questions:
- what would you prefer: dedicated hosts or public github or private
github (less infra disclosure, less possible attack)
- would this kind of central repository be used on other .ocaml.org hosts ?
- in case you prefer a host: Anil can you set a small instance (1CPU,
3GB DD, 512MB RAM)
- in case you prefer a github repository: Am I allowed to create a
private/public github repository on ocaml.org ?
- I will inject some fusionforge packages + custom scripts packages,
OCaml Labs/OCamlPro people do you have some packages to inject as well
?

Regards
Sylvain

I agree -- I'd like to have a small host for nothing but password and key
information, and use that to bounce off to all the other infrastructure
hosts.  If possible, it would be good not to have any customisation on
there at all (or indeed, Internet-facing web services such as admin
panels) -- could you host those on another VM?

Rackspace has a nice facility for setting up internal networks, so we
could run SSH on other services only exposed to this bounce box.

Yes, that was the purpose of my request. I want to have in another VM.
Given the fact that it will be almost no admin, it would be easy to
setup and just create a Debian repository there.

I do not want to share forge.ocaml.org or ssh.ocaml.org VM, because it
will be too sensitive. This is the reason of my request, you will
probably have to set up a VM for those specifically (add my SSH keys
that I have sent you for setting up forge.o.o and ssh.o.o).

Subject: [ocaml-infra] Migrating to the new ocaml.org design
Message-ID: <1666BD05-B4BC-4D0A-8799-0693924422CD@cam.ac.uk>

Hi everyone,

Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing the new ocaml.org site design and how we should migrate to it.

You can see the current design up at http://ocaml-redesign.github.io and the idea for merging this into the main site is the following:

1. We fork the current site into a new branch on the main GitHub repository (the new branch would be called 'redesign').

2. We clean up and replay our git commits on this new branch.  This gets us to the current redesign site but in an 'official' place.  

3. We build a live version of the redesign branch (like we already have) and ask the community to review it and report any bugs or problems. We triage those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.

4. After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we merge the site into the main branch.  This would effectively present the new site to the world.  

During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on the old site but would be happy to accept them on the new branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.

As I mentioned in earlier emails, the above is only intended to merge the *design* and *toolchain* for the new site.  Specifically, we've created new landing pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site's contents as well as made some new libraries [1, 2].  The new toolchain means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a lot easier.  

Since the files are on GitHub, people don't even need to clone the site locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the 'Edit this page' link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the repository and GitHub's editing and pull request features will allow you to make changes and submit updates, all without leaving your browser [3].  

There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed and merged.

Hi,

I did a quick review of the pages and I have a few remarks:
- no mention of the OCaml Forge
- no mention of Planet OCaml (after all you are extracting news from there)
- in Packages I would like to title the main section "OPAM packages",
because that what they are.
- please add more books than just "Real World OCaml"
- 2 out of 3 talks from Yaron (I mean I have nothing against Yaron but
there are other videos around the web).
- you could add the G+ community for OCaml

Overall, and I am sorry to say that, but the website is promoting
quite strongly a single point of view (which look a lot like Jane
Street/OCamlPro/OCamlLab). Don't forget that there are some OTHER
people working on things like the OCaml Forge and that may feel that
it is totally useless since it is not even mentioned into a single
page of the new site.

Regards
Sylvain

Hi Sylvain,

If you read Amir's mail below more carefully, you'll see:

> As I mentioned in earlier emails, the above is only intended to merge
> the *design* and *toolchain* for the new site.

The content on the redesign is a strawman to facilitate the design process,
and the existing content won't change (but will be a lot easier to hack on
with the new Markdown-based toolchain).

So -- if you feel that the Forge isn't adequately represented on the existing
ocaml.org site, then you should either create an issue or (preferably) send
in a content patch.  Noone can represent your interests better than you...

This is great!  One idea here to make it easier for third parties to contribute: use Travis to build and deploy the resulting HTML so that forks can have a version of the site on their GitHub pages.  I often find I want to send in a small patch, so I wonder if automating it all through Travis would ease the need for having to have a script running somewhere.

I've left the instructions for a secure Travis deployment in:
http://anil.recoil.org/2013/10/06/travis-secure-ssh-integration.html

(this is working well for the Mirage website rebuild so far, which is considerably more involved that ocaml.org)

Taking back part of my grievance:
- I found the page about the planet (although not obvious, but I
should not complain about the planet being in a more central place)

Maybe I should dig deeper to find the other items.

I was planning to do some change on the actual forge to make things
more clear and fix other things. But is it really a 1:1 re-map between
the old design and the new design ?

If I make change to the current will they end up in the new design ?

There was some links in the old design to the forge... like on the first page !

Hi everyone,

I want to reassure everyone that all the content from the old site is still present but there may be broken links, which this review would help to surface. The only page that's been reworked is the front page and we need people in the community to help us to both identify and fill the gaps with the new site.  

To take a specific example, http://ocaml-redesign.github.io/learn/books still exists but isn't linked properly from other pages on the site.  The placeholder for books which Sylvain noticed should ideally be a carousel that cycles through *all* the books we have (with appropriate links) but we don't have that feature yet.  In addition, I'd personally like to submit a review of "OCaml from the very beginning" so this definitely isn't a case of presenting only one view -- In any case, I certainly wouldn't expect such a view to hold very long as anyone is able to contribute and improve content.

Please bear in mind that we're not even on Step 1 of the plan I outlined (though it is a trivial one).  I want to make sure the overall plan seems reasonable and then ensure we capture everything while in Step 3.

Best wishes,
Amir

Let me reboot my mail thread and try to understand how to fix things.

I am not sure how you will migrate content change from the current
branch to your redesign branch.

So in my mind, the step 2.5 will look like:

2.5 Convert HTML page of the current master into Markdown file

3. ....

So if I am correct, if I want to add a join "OCaml on G+" button on
community, I can do it right now or wait for you to reach 3. ?

Since this change involves some pieces of HTML (can't do it in
markdown), will it work with the redesign ?

Regards
Sylvain

Subject: [ocaml-infra] Long tern project: merging lists.ocaml.org and
	lists.ocamlcore.org
Message-ID: <CAOCAUGP2pwiCv9ZUEuXMAUk60UHF5WRT6kP7zqhx2SjeD6WGAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just to ask if it will make sense to merge lists.ocaml.org and
lists.ocamlcore.org. On the long term, ocamlcore.org will be
deprecated in favor of ocaml.org. At this point we will have to make a
decision about wether or not we should merge the mailing list server
as well.

Pros:
- injecting data from the forge (like list of valid email address
extracted from forge DB) will help to reduce spam
- easier to setup anti-spam for a single instance

Cons:
- lots of mailing list from the forge, maybe we want to just highlight
"some" important one (like wg-camlp4)

Alternative:
- host mailing list on lists.forge.ocaml.org.

What's your opinion on this topic ?

This is an open question, I won't implement it tomorrow, so we have
time to deal with the question.

Regards
Sylvain

I guess the simplest way is to point you to a set of commits we've made on an existing fork of the site [1].  That way you can see the intermediate steps that happen during Step 2.  This step is scripted so I hope that clarifies what I meant when I said 'clean up and replay our git commits' on the redesign branch.  At the moment, we're still cleaning things up.

Although you can do it now, my preference is to add the OCaml on G+ button on the redesign branch.  There shouldn't be any issue with HTML.

Does that help to clarify?

Yes.

I would like in fact to change some stuff in the new design to make
some of the forge/planet/oasis/g+/twitter/linkedin a little more
prominent. No big ads but enough to feel that I am part of the
community. So I think I'll wait for the redesign branch to send PR.

Please  go ahead with your plan and let's talk about real changes (I
mean OK for the redesign, but I will propose some changes to the
content when you reach step 3.)

Does it make sense ?

Cheers

This makes sense -- I'd like to customize that front page a little to
categorize mailing lists better, so we could just migrate all the lists
over and then build some regexps to put "commits" lists separately from
projects.

Is your mailman setup customized very much at the moment on the Forge?
I've made no special changes to the ocaml.org one.  It's also proxied by
the Cambridge University mail service, so excess load shouldn't be a
problem.

Right now this almost plain mailman. The forge create mailing list
through standard command call.

I wish to implement a specific queue like
http://sourceforge.net/projects/assp/ + whitelist of email address
extracted from the forge. This should not be too hard to implement and
will drastically reduce the amount of spam (~1 mail every 2 days on
admin at lists.ocamlcore.org).

The only constraint is that he mailman should be in the same container
as the the forge.

Sylvain

I took a quick shot a trying out GitLab to act as a mirror.  This is *very* experimental, but here's what it looks like on git.ocaml.org:

http://git.ocaml.org/ocaml-compiler/ocaml/commits/master
(I didn't set this up on a staging domain due to the pain of reconfiguration).

There's only one project on there at a moment: a static checkout of the OCaml Git mirror, but I can script up a proper GitHub/Forge mirror quite easily from this.  I'm inclined to disable user signups for this and make it a pure mirror, though.

Sounds good -- let me check up whether or not the existing ocaml.org is
spam filtered by the University systems.  If so, we don't have to worry
about maintaining another bit of software.

I think the best place to have this kind of mirror is in Forge (but I
think you agree if I understand you correctly).

Proposal:
- create a forge.ocamlcore.org project called "github-mirror"
- have a main git repository (in github or in the forge) that contains
a file "github-url-to-mirror"

In a cronjob on ssh.ocamlcore.org:
- checkout the main git repository
- loop over the entries of github-url-to-mirror and check them out in
/home/group/github-mirror/gitroot/

For the nice GitLab interface, contact me so that we can install the
required DB and ruby packages. However you'll probably have to install
gitlab by yourself, except if you know where I can find a debian
package for it, and point it to /home/group/github-mirror/gitroot...

User signup -> agree that it should be disabled.

Does it make sense ?

Regards
Sylvain
