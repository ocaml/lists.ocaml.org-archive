Ashish, is there a staging site for ocaml.org at the moment, where people can preview content before it's pushed?

Martin Keegan (CCed) is asking as he's interested in working on the dev tools page, and wants to show it to other people.  It should be easy to rig one up easily enough if it doesn't already exist.

cheers,
Anil

It looks like the build system for the website involves compiling bits of
OCaml, which might be an argument for not letting randoms access it at
their own discretion, which itself might be an argument for something
more static, e.g., Jekyll/ Markdown.

Even though we are thinking to move to, say, Markdown, that won't
change much w.r.t. that "problem".  The website is mostly static but
some things have to be automated.  You can use your github account to
display the generated pages.

Hope it helps,

We don't have a dev preview site. How about pushing to the gh-pages branch
of your fork on github?
