Subject: [ocaml-infra] VM resources for running bridge bots
Message-ID: <CAN6ygO=gVRYTzko=jjuOu6j7Wbkf-MuxCWwiOeXVXDaJZgvquw@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to bridge the new discord server with the IRC channel, which
will require a VM on which to run a bot. Also, it's possible we'll
create an OCaml community on matrix which will mirror the discord
server. This will also require bots.

Would it be possible to receive access to community resources for this
task? I (Yotam Barnoy) am the maintainer for the project.

Dear Yotam,

This should be fine - I?ll provision a VM in the experimental services pool (this gives it an expiry date of six months or so, at which point we will revisit and check it is still being used/maintained). Could you please send me an SSH key and preferred username.

Regards
Anil
