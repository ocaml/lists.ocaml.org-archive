Subject: [ocamlweb-devel] new OCaml website
Message-ID: <CAMu2m2JktBRuL6J=TetNLYmn6UFXk4sksyRs0Tr53yW1RVK+AQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Thank you for joining the ocamlweb-devel mailing list. We would like to
progress in two directions simultaneously: create content and write the code
for a dynamic Ocisgen based site.

Content:
Christophe Troestler has built a draft site [1]. You can simply check out
the code from the forge, and start filling in missing parts.

Ocsigen:
We need help to get this started. Please let us know if you want to take the
lead on getting the basic code in place.

There may appear to be duplication in the effort here. We are building the
content site with raw html, and this will later be ported into the Ocsigen
site. This is for practical reasons. The Ocsigen site will take time to
build, and we do not want to delay writing the content, which is an equally
big task.

You own this site. Your suggestions and leadership on any aspect are welcome
at all times.

Best,
Ashish

Subject: new project for an OCaml community website
To: Caml List <caml-list at inria.fr>


Dear OCaml List,

An effort to build a new modern website for the OCaml community was
announced at the User Meeting in April. We now have a project on the forge
and welcome you to join. There are several ways to be involved:

Join the mailing list [1] for developers, which will be used to discuss
implementation of the site, including coding matters and decisions about
content. Discussions requiring input from the broader community will still
be posted to the main list.

Become a developer by clicking the "Request to join" link [2]. Developers
are those who will actively write code for the site, and at first developers
will also be writing the bulk of the content. Eventually, we hope the
community will add content directly on the site via wiki like features. Our
plan is to implement the site in Ocsigen, so this is a great opportunity to
learn about this exciting new set of tools for OCaml.

Suggest ideas to the development team. We are maintaing an ideas file [3]
listing our desired features. Please review it, and give us your feedback.
