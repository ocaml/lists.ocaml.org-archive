Hi Florent, thanks for your comments.  

Anyone is very welcome to suggest changes or propose new ideas and I encourage this.  However, if you're referring to paid design work I should point out that we're already working with a professional design agency and have been since earlier this year [1].  The output of this work is posted up on the github wiki for ocaml.org [2] and on this mailing list (with the occasional post on the caml-list).  I've also started to blog more about it, which should find it's way into OCaml Planet (e.g the post I linked to previously).  

I've posted all the design options I have, so there aren't any other versions to look at.  I gave the agency a specific brief that the logo had to work in a square shape and have a bactrian camel.  If others are willing to make their ideas public then the best elements of those can still find their way into the final design (though I'd be wary of design by committee).  We're quite far into this process now and since you're the first person to mention it, I haven't had the impression this is something people wanted to do.

In any case, the end result is intended to be a new design for the ocaml.org site and a logo that is released to the community (probably under a creative commons licence, with svg files etc).  People will be able to modify it if they wish, though it would be great if people felt they could use the logo as is.

I hope the above answers your questions. Do you have specific comments on either the design or logo?  I'd love to hear them.

Best wishes,
Amir
