<PRE>Ashish, Christophe,

I'd like to start discussing how we migrate the existing ocaml.org to the new design and structure.  We do still have a lot of pieces to complete and Philippe has been collating a list of issues we need to deal with on the tracker [1].  It would be great if we can get your input on these and work out a plan to move the design over.  I'd really like to  get this done over the next couple of weeks.

My preference is to only deal with the site design and structure for the moment and leave new features (e.g packages/docs) until after the design is up.

Specific things to consider are that the new site uses markdown, based on the existing source html.  I'm expecting that we generate the markdown as we did for our fork and archive the current source files.  There is also the URL structure as I've moved many things into subfolders based on the navigation menu.  The URLs are based on this folder structure, which I hope makes it easier for people to mentally map the repo contents to the live site.  Philipe's also added an 'edit this page' link in the footer, which makes it easier for people to contribute quick fixes (it was something many people asked for and it works well but still needs some tweaks ).

Thoughts and comments are appreciated!

&gt;<i> Dear all,

</I>&gt;<i> I've just put up a blog post asking for feedback on the ocaml.org redesign [1].  I'm specifically interested in getting feedback on (1) the second iteration of the OCaml Logo and (2) the new design for ocaml.org.  See the blog post for more information.  We're tracking feedback via issues [2] and there are some known issues already listed there.
