</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Technically speaking, you own the final say on the namespace,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; so you make the decision in case of conflict :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Not sure!  Before posting I re-read the governance document, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; case my questions were already answered there.  According to this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; document, I do own the final say on hostnames in the ocaml.org domain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But the Github ocaml/ organization &amp; namespace is something different,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not covered (yet?) in the governance document.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I suspect that, as one of the admins of this organization, I wield
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; considerable technical power there as well.  But I definitely don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; want to misuse or abuse it, hence my questions re: policy and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; procedure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear Xavier,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good point -- I will put GitHub on the list of things to add to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governance doc. We also need somewhere to stash private keys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for infrastructure machines as well, so there are a few other items
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of that nature that warrant a refresh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The governance doc was specifically written for the ocaml.org domain.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it can be modified and extended to cover other things but the
</I>&gt;<i> management and policy around code repos was not part of the original scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mention this in case anyone think it&#8217;ll be a trivial thing to add :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; So far, the policy has been any project that is reasonably needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; for the operation of the ocaml.org infrastructure. Some of them are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; obvious: [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; When we first created the GitHub org, it was also the home for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; some popular community libraries: [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; More recently of course, the OCaml compiler and its tools have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; also started moving over: [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; So now that we have been using GitHub for a few years, there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; is quite an array of libraries on the ocaml/ organisation, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; possibly time to do a garbage collection and disaggregate the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; namespace if necessary.
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As far as the number of projects in ocaml/ remains tractable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (e.g. tens, not hundreds), it's OK to host all of them and not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; worry too much about reorganization.  My (hypothetical) concern is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; what happens do if, say, all projects from forge.ocamlcore.org ask to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; migrate to the /ocaml/ organization on Github?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been wondering about this also.  Perhaps we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take the initiative and create an ocaml-forge organisation that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirrors the existing Forge Git repositories?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We cannot do much about issues, but it's fairly straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirror the source code.  SVN will require an authoritative mirror
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since the results of SVN2Git aren't always reproducible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC Forge offers multiple features: Code, Mailing lists, and Issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; Code &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> I would think that the correct analogy for this aspect of Forge would be
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub itself. i.e. the maintainers move their repos/code to their own
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces/orgs on GitHub.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of those would make sense to move to /ocaml but that would involve a
</I>&gt;<i> case-by-case discussion between the owners of /ocaml (i.e. you) and the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers of those codebases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mirroring the existing Git repos into an &#8216;ocaml-forge&#8217; organisation, as
</I>&gt;<i> Anil suggests, might also be a good way to facilitate a mass migration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a sidenote, there are benefits and trade-offs to moving projects into a
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub organisation.  For example, the owners of a GitHub organisation have
</I>&gt;<i> push access to all the repositories within their org, which is worth
</I>&gt;<i> bearing in mind.  On the other hand, managing teams and collaborators is a
</I>&gt;<i> little easier from within an organisation. Projects could make their own
</I>&gt;<i> organisations if they wish &#8212; e.g. Merlin lives under an organisation rather
</I>&gt;<i> than an individual&#8217;s account, <A HREF="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin.">https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; Mailing lists &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible to set up mailing lists on lists.ocaml.org and move
</I>&gt;<i> archives over.  This has happened before so I don&#8217;t imagine any
</I>&gt;<i> difficulties, other than logistics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; Issues &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> As Anil said, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s much to be done about Issue Trackers
</I>&gt;<i> and Task lists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In Merlin's case, Fred also provided the mailing list archive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that has been migrated to lists.ocaml.org now:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/issues/5">https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/issues/5</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; It would be great to keep the [libraries formerly in the compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; distribution] underneath the ocaml/ organisation.  There is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; precedent for moving important core libraries such as Zarith into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ocaml/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Duly noted.  But Nums and Zarith were two easy examples :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Concretely: I'll try to work on the otherlibs/num -&gt; ocaml/num[s]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; migration in the coming weeks, and will ask for help if I can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; manage.  For other possible &quot;immigrant&quot; projects, let's give other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; people on this list time to think about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Makes sense.  I am also CCing Sylvain onto this thread in case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he is not on the Infrastructure list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since Sylvain is listed as Maintainer for a sub-domain he should already
</I>&gt;<i> be on the infrastructure list :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i> Amir

&#8203;Hi all,&#8203;

&#8203;I wanted to help but wasn't sure how to begin with. Based on comments here
I've added a list of all of the repositories currently within the ocaml/
organisation to an /infrastructure/ wiki page: <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/">https://github.com/ocaml/</A>
infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories so we can easily see what is
there and where we might organise things.

The infrastructure wiki might be a good place to provide more of an
overview of the OCaml ecosystem, and not just machine resources. Some
ideas/questions:

* We can pin 6 of the main repositories to the OCaml organisation page as
per the Mirage organisation page: <A HREF="https://github.com/mirage">https://github.com/mirage</A>

* The wiki: <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki">https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki</A> is a little out of
date - perhaps we could refresh/reorganise it?

* Rather than migrating, we can link to other OCaml libraries that are
relevant to the core ocaml.org ecosystem such as
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml-doc,">https://github.com/ocaml-doc,</A> <A HREF="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin">https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin</A> that
are incorporated within their own organisations

* Shall we link to other third party libraries that are important/relevant
to the core compiler? e.g. Spacetime, AFL

&#8203;Thanks,

Gemma&#8203;
