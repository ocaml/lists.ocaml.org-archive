<PRE>Dear Anil,

Thanks for your quick and informative reply.

Not sure!  Before posting I re-read the governance document, in
case my questions were already answered there.  According to this
document, I do own the final say on hostnames in the ocaml.org domain.
But the Github ocaml/ organization &amp; namespace is something different,
not covered (yet?) in the governance document.

I suspect that, as one of the admins of this organization, I wield
considerable technical power there as well.  But I definitely don't
want to misuse or abuse it, hence my questions re: policy and
procedure.


&gt;<i> So far, the policy has been any project that is reasonably needed
</I>&gt;<i> for the operation of the ocaml.org infrastructure. Some of them are
</I>&gt;<i> obvious: [...]
</I>&gt;<i> When we first created the GitHub org, it was also the home for

</I>&gt;<i> More recently of course, the OCaml compiler and its tools have 
</I>&gt;<i> also started moving over: [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So now that we have been using GitHub for a few years, there
</I>&gt;<i> is quite an array of libraries on the ocaml/ organisation, and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly time to do a garbage collection and disaggregate the
</I>&gt;<i> namespace if necessary.
</I>
As far as the number of projects in ocaml/ remains tractable
(e.g. tens, not hundreds), it's OK to host all of them and not
worry too much about reorganization.  My (hypothetical) concern is:
what happens do if, say, all projects from forge.ocamlcore.org ask to
migrate to the /ocaml/ organization on Github?

&gt;<i> It would be great to keep the [libraries formerly in the compiler
</I>&gt;<i> distribution] underneath the ocaml/ organisation.  There is also
</I>&gt;<i> precedent for moving important core libraries such as Zarith into
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml/
</I>
Duly noted.  But Nums and Zarith were two easy examples :-)

Concretely: I'll try to work on the otherlibs/num -&gt; ocaml/num[s]
migration in the coming weeks, and will ask for help if I can't
manage.  For other possible &quot;immigrant&quot; projects, let's give other
people on this list time to think about it.

Best,

- Xavier
