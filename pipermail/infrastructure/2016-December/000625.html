Dear Xavier,

This is indeed the correct list.

&gt;<i> What are the policy and the procedure to create (or migrate) projects

</I>
So far, the policy has been any project that is reasonably needed
for the operation of the ocaml.org infrastructure. Some of them are
obvious:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure">https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web">https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-rt">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-rt</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/platform-blog">https://github.com/ocaml/platform-blog</A>

Then there are libraries which are necessary for transitional purposes,
such as <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/uchar.">https://github.com/ocaml/uchar.</A>

When we first created the GitHub org, it was also the home for
some popular community libraries:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis">https://github.com/ocaml/oasis</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2opam">https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2opam</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2debian">https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2debian</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis-db">https://github.com/ocaml/oasis-db</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/omd">https://github.com/ocaml/omd</A>

More recently of course, the OCaml compiler and its tools have 
also started moving over:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4">https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild">https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-manual">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-manual</A>

So now that we have been using GitHub for a few years, there
is quite an array of libraries on the ocaml/ organisation, and
possibly time to do a garbage collection and disaggregate the
namespace if necessary.

&gt;<i> The reason I ask is that there are a number of OCaml projects
</I>&gt;<i> residing currently on forges like forge.ocamlcore.org and that are
</I>&gt;<i> considering moving to Github.  There are also parts of the core OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> distribution that should move to independent projects, again
</I>&gt;<i> preferably on Github.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of those projects fit well in the /ocaml/ organization but not
</I>&gt;<i> all of them can be accommodated there, I'm afraid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, what is the policy?  how to request a new /ocaml/xxx project?
</I>&gt;<i> who takes the decision?
</I>
Technically speaking, you own the final say on the namespace,
so you make the decision in case of conflict :-)  In practise, we've
just discussed it on a per-project basis and made hopefully sensible
decisions so far without bothering you.

&gt;<i> Personally, pretty soon I'll need an /ocaml/num or /ocaml/bignums
</I>&gt;<i> project to host the otherlibs/num library that is currently part of
</I>&gt;<i> the core OCaml distro.  I think /ocaml/zarith would make a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> sense too, but I need to discuss with the other ZArith authors first.
</I>
It would be great to keep the [libraries formerly in the compiler
distribution] underneath the ocaml/ organisation.  There is also
precedent for moving important core libraries such as Zarith into
ocaml/

As a separate step, it may make sense to move some of the
OPAM infrastructure into a separate organisation, since OPAM2
is now more OCaml-independent than it ever has been.

I see no reason to tightly couple these decisions -- it would be
good to get repositories established for the disaggregated portions
of the distributions as soon as possible.  You should have admin
rights on the organisation to do this, and I can of course assist
as you need and ensure that the ACLs are correct or the new
repositories.

regards,
Anil
