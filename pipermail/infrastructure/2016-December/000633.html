<PRE>&gt;<i> It would be good to have a short page about infrastructure on ocaml.org
</I>as well -- would you (or anyone else on the thread) have suggestions for
where to put this on the website?

I think it would fit best under Documentation.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The governance doc was specifically written for the ocaml.org domain.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good point.  It would be useful to clarify this scope though, since the
</I>&gt;<i> governance doc makes several references to &quot;code repositories&quot; that are all
</I>&gt;<i> hosted
</I>&gt;<i> in the GitHub ocaml/ org.  So it seems quite relevant to organise those
</I>&gt;<i> code repositories under the same framework as the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure that they eventually drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mention this in case anyone think it&#8217;ll be a trivial thing to add :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just to make it clear to everyone:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The forge will be deprecated but I haven't made an official statement
</I>&gt;<i> about it (pending). The official recommendation will be to migrate projects
</I>&gt;<i> to Github, but I'll keep a STATIC website of the forge -- for the project
</I>&gt;<i> that have no plan to migrate.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;...&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mass migration under an organisation is still an option for the Forge
</I>&gt;<i> migration but:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - it will generate quite a lot of work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - lot of long discussions (some project may not want to be mass migrated
</I>&gt;<i> to github, but would prefer GitLab or other)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - probably only 20 migrated repositories will be active afterward
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keeping a static copy of the existing Forge would be very useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding mass migration, I was thinking of simply git cloning the existing
</I>&gt;<i> repositories into a mirror namespace on GitHub, and doing nothing further.
</I>&gt;<i> Individual maintainers from the Forge could then be granted write access
</I>&gt;<i> and/or the repositories transferred if they choose, but at a minimum simply
</I>&gt;<i> keeping a copy of code, history and tags would provide OPAM with a useful
</I>&gt;<i> mirror alternative to the Forge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If maintainers do want GitLab, they will have to host it themselves...

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for jumping in here, Gemma!  To be clear, we (&quot;infrastructure&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> welcome anyone who wishes to help maintain the growing set of repositories,
</I>&gt;<i> so please do feel free to ask clarification questions about anything that
</I>&gt;<i> is undocumented or otherwise confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based on comments here I've added a list of all of the repositories
</I>&gt;<i> currently within the ocaml/ organisation to an /infrastructure/ wiki page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories">https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories</A>
</I>&gt;<i> so we can easily see what is there and where we might organise things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've edited this to add some more information.  It would be good to have a
</I>&gt;<i> short page about infrastructure on ocaml.org as well -- would you (or
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else on the thread) have suggestions for where to put this on the
</I>&gt;<i> website?  I'm keen to avoid wiki proliferation and have one place on
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml.org where people can be directed to this kind of information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The infrastructure wiki might be a good place to provide more of an
</I>&gt;<i> overview of the OCaml ecosystem, and not just machine resources. Some
</I>&gt;<i> ideas/questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * We can pin 6 of the main repositories to the OCaml organisation page
</I>&gt;<i> as per the Mirage organisation page: <A HREF="https://github.com/mirage">https://github.com/mirage</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good; how about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml-manual
</I>&gt;<i> ocamlbuild
</I>&gt;<i> opam
</I>&gt;<i> opam-repository
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml.org
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This covers the core compiler, OPAM and the website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * The wiki: <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki">https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki</A> is a little
</I>&gt;<i> out of date - perhaps we could refresh/reorganise it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My fault I'm afraid. I'll take a pass a bit later on...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Rather than migrating, we can link to other OCaml libraries that are
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to the core ocaml.org ecosystem such as
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml-doc,">https://github.com/ocaml-doc,</A> <A HREF="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin">https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin</A>
</I>&gt;<i> that are incorporated within their own organisations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Shall we link to other third party libraries that are
</I>&gt;<i> important/relevant to the core compiler? e.g. Spacetime, AFL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very good point.  One of my concerns is that the various new
</I>&gt;<i> features in OCaml are quite spread out now. Spacetime's implementation is
</I>&gt;<i> on [either Leo or Jane Street] person repos, the ocaml-doc is its own
</I>&gt;<i> organisation, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would there be any objection to also starting discussions with various
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers about migrating in &quot;headline&quot; projects such as Spacetime UIs
</I>&gt;<i> into the ocaml/ org?  I'd suggest only doing this once the feature is in a
</I>&gt;<i> released compiler distribution, since then the maintenance burden is
</I>&gt;<i> established for some time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for all the rapid and helpful responses, Amir, Sylvain and
</I>&gt;<i> Gemma.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> regards,
