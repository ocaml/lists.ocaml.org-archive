Subject: [ocaml-infra] TLS (https) for ocaml.org
Message-ID: <53F4A6DF.4060302@cam.ac.uk>

Hello, world!

I just turned on SSLv3 and TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 for ocaml.org using 
lighttpd's SSL engine. The ocaml.org server configuration does not 
appear to be version-controlled.

Here is what I did:

- loaded the private certificate onto ocaml.org
- symlinked private certificate into lighttpd's config
- symlinked lighttpd's default SSL configuration into "conf-enabled":

$SERVER["socket"] == "0.0.0.0:443" {
	ssl.engine  = "enable"
	ssl.pemfile = "/etc/lighttpd/server.pem"

	ssl.cipher-list = 
"ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:AES256-SHA256:RC4:HIGH:!MD5:!aNULL:!EDH:!AESGCM"
	ssl.honor-cipher-order = "enable"
}

- reloaded the lighttpd daemon's configuration with /etc/init.d script
- tested that both the vanilla and encrypted HTTP ports work
- ran the Qualys SSL Tests 
<https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=ocaml.org>

Here's what the tests found:

- Prefix handling 	Not valid for "www.ocaml.org"   CONFUSING
   This causes a Big Scary Warning when accessing via www.ocaml.org
- Chain issues 	Incomplete
   This requires another download of the Gandi Standard SSL CA cert.
   Maybe we should bundle this cert for all our TLS sites?
- RC4 	Yes (with TLS 1.1 and newer)   WEAK
   I don't know the severity of this issue. Maybe a simple cipher-list
   modification? I'm not clear on the compatibility story.
- Forward Secrecy 	With some browsers
   This also looks like a configuration issue. Perhaps plain DHE would
   help?

I welcome any feedback here or on 
<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/399>. Please test the site, 
recommend configuration changes, and look for mixed content issues on 
all pages. The goal is to get the TLS-served version of the site ready 
to be pointed at by the middle next week.

Thanks,

David

Hello, world!

We have gathered here at the confluence of two great rivers:
opam.ocaml.org and ocaml.org. They meet here and flow on,
indistinguishable and majestic to the sea. Please join me on the bank
and bathe in the healing waters of...

OPAM.OCAML.ORG

<https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web/pull/113>

A number of things are slightly broken:

- I didn't port the CSS rules to center the buttons on the Home page.
- I had to disable the affix feature of the Documentation and Blog
sidebars (see <https://github.com/dsheets/opam2web/commit/9fa8b1cc142a2a287876cc69e15e40e066b33a41>).

Your comments and patches are welcome.

Thanks,

David

We try to document what we do with the machine serving ocaml.org on
this wiki: https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki
Could you please add your changes?  Thanks.

Cheers,

you might want to enable https only for ocaml.org, docs.ocaml.org,
forge.ocaml.org, lists.ocaml.org, and opam.ocaml.org (those hostnames
mentioned in the certificate)?

Yes, that should be done. While my firefox does not complain about the
certificate chain (most likely it already has ghandi's certificate
installed), the server should distribute the chain up till the
self-signed CA certificate -- thus please include ghandi's cert.

windows XP with (unpatched) IE6 still supports only 3DES and RC4,
other OS should be fine without RC4
(http://blog.cloudflare.com/killing-rc4-the-long-goodbye might be of
interest); also
http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4-00.txt

I'd remove the !EDH from the ssl.cipher-list above (and add a !RSA
instead to prevent non-pfs connections). Also, why !AESGCM? I'd also
add !RC4, !eNULL, !LOW, !EXP (from
https://bettercrypto.org/static/applied-crypto-hardening.pdf)

I found the repository but it was empty and I didn't think to look in
the wiki. I've made an issue in the repo to add a simple README so
people don't get lost in the future. I also updated the wiki with the
certificate stuff.

Thanks,

David
