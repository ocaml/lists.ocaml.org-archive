Subject: [ocaml-infra] github/ocaml/ocaml trunk synchronization issue
Message-ID: <CAPFanBHnQGGREy4YdSH5UE=amuah4HvyN-q0xMhvVpvcnOT3yw@mail.gmail.com>

The synchronization of github/ocaml/ocaml with trunk seems to be somehow
stopped:
  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk

The last commit I see is Jeremy's, commited on Apr 12, while the SVN has
commits upto Apr 15. On the other hand, commits in the 4.02 branch are
uptodate.

It may be no coincidence that this commit is recognized by github as
Jeremy's (despite having been pushed by myself), which is usually not the
case for SVN commits (if I knew how to reliably have git-svn recover
correct authorship information, I would do it each time). Could the
synchronization script be confused by the difference between the commit's
authorship date (Feb 10) and actual commit date? Did I do something really
silly without noticing?

(Please don't tell me the only solution is to merge pull requests on the
same day they are sent!)

Did someone commit directly to the GitHub mirror?  It looks like a merge conflict happened on trunk in the Changes file.

I've kicked off a reinitialisation of the ocaml.git from the SVN (and preserved the old, conflicting one).  If the fresh one works, then I'll swap over to that.
