Subject: [ocaml-infra] new Github projects under the "ocaml" organization
Message-ID: <c8730508-5ba4-ff26-1c12-4dec0e90bcb6@inria.fr>

Dear all,

I hope this is the right list to ask this question:

What are the policy and the procedure to create (or migrate) projects
to Github under the /ocaml/ organization?

The reason I ask is that there are a number of OCaml projects
residing currently on forges like forge.ocamlcore.org and that are
considering moving to Github.  There are also parts of the core OCaml
distribution that should move to independent projects, again
preferably on Github.

Some of those projects fit well in the /ocaml/ organization but not
all of them can be accommodated there, I'm afraid.

So, what is the policy?  how to request a new /ocaml/xxx project?
who takes the decision?

Personally, pretty soon I'll need an /ocaml/num or /ocaml/bignums
project to host the otherlibs/num library that is currently part of
the core OCaml distro.  I think /ocaml/zarith would make a lot of
sense too, but I need to discuss with the other ZArith authors first.

Kind regards,

- Xavier Leroy

Dear Xavier,

This is indeed the correct list.

So far, the policy has been any project that is reasonably needed
for the operation of the ocaml.org infrastructure. Some of them are
obvious:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-media
https://github.com/ocaml/opam
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-depext
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-file-format
https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts
https://github.com/ocaml/opam2web
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-rt
https://github.com/ocaml/platform-blog

Then there are libraries which are necessary for transitional purposes,
such as https://github.com/ocaml/uchar.

When we first created the GitHub org, it was also the home for
some popular community libraries:

https://github.com/ocaml/oasis
https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2opam
https://github.com/ocaml/oasis2debian
https://github.com/ocaml/oasis-db
https://github.com/ocaml/omd

More recently of course, the OCaml compiler and its tools have 
also started moving over:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml
https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4
https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg
https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-manual

So now that we have been using GitHub for a few years, there
is quite an array of libraries on the ocaml/ organisation, and
possibly time to do a garbage collection and disaggregate the
namespace if necessary.

Technically speaking, you own the final say on the namespace,
so you make the decision in case of conflict :-)  In practise, we've
just discussed it on a per-project basis and made hopefully sensible
decisions so far without bothering you.

It would be great to keep the [libraries formerly in the compiler
distribution] underneath the ocaml/ organisation.  There is also
precedent for moving important core libraries such as Zarith into
ocaml/

As a separate step, it may make sense to move some of the
OPAM infrastructure into a separate organisation, since OPAM2
is now more OCaml-independent than it ever has been.

I see no reason to tightly couple these decisions -- it would be
good to get repositories established for the disaggregated portions
of the distributions as soon as possible.  You should have admin
rights on the organisation to do this, and I can of course assist
as you need and ensure that the ACLs are correct or the new
repositories.

Anil

Not sure!  Before posting I re-read the governance document, in
case my questions were already answered there.  According to this
document, I do own the final say on hostnames in the ocaml.org domain.
But the Github ocaml/ organization & namespace is something different,
not covered (yet?) in the governance document.

I suspect that, as one of the admins of this organization, I wield
considerable technical power there as well.  But I definitely don't
want to misuse or abuse it, hence my questions re: policy and
procedure.

As far as the number of projects in ocaml/ remains tractable
(e.g. tens, not hundreds), it's OK to host all of them and not
worry too much about reorganization.  My (hypothetical) concern is:
what happens do if, say, all projects from forge.ocamlcore.org ask to
migrate to the /ocaml/ organization on Github?

Duly noted.  But Nums and Zarith were two easy examples :-)

Concretely: I'll try to work on the otherlibs/num -> ocaml/num[s]
migration in the coming weeks, and will ask for help if I can't
manage.  For other possible "immigrant" projects, let's give other
people on this list time to think about it.

Best,

- Xavier

Dear Xavier,

Good point -- I will put GitHub on the list of things to add to the
governance doc. We also need somewhere to stash private keys
for infrastructure machines as well, so there are a few other items
of that nature that warrant a refresh.

I have been wondering about this also.  Perhaps we should 
take the initiative and create an ocaml-forge organisation that
mirrors the existing Forge Git repositories?
We cannot do much about issues, but it's fairly straightforward to
mirror the source code.  SVN will require an authoritative mirror
since the results of SVN2Git aren't always reproducible.

In Merlin's case, Fred also provided the mailing list archive,
so that has been migrated to lists.ocaml.org now:
https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/issues/5

Makes sense.  I am also CCing Sylvain onto this thread in case
he is not on the Infrastructure list.

The governance doc was specifically written for the ocaml.org domain.
Of course, it can be modified and extended to cover other things but the management and policy around code repos was not part of the original scope.

I mention this in case anyone think it?ll be a trivial thing to add :)

IIRC Forge offers multiple features: Code, Mailing lists, and Issues.

? Code ?
I would think that the correct analogy for this aspect of Forge would be GitHub itself. i.e. the maintainers move their repos/code to their own namespaces/orgs on GitHub.

Some of those would make sense to move to /ocaml but that would involve a case-by-case discussion between the owners of /ocaml (i.e. you) and the maintainers of those codebases.  

Mirroring the existing Git repos into an ?ocaml-forge? organisation, as Anil suggests, might also be a good way to facilitate a mass migration.

As a sidenote, there are benefits and trade-offs to moving projects into a GitHub organisation.  For example, the owners of a GitHub organisation have push access to all the repositories within their org, which is worth bearing in mind.  On the other hand, managing teams and collaborators is a little easier from within an organisation. Projects could make their own organisations if they wish ? e.g. Merlin lives under an organisation rather than an individual?s account, https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin.  

? Mailing lists ?
It's possible to set up mailing lists on lists.ocaml.org and move archives over.  This has happened before so I don?t imagine any difficulties, other than logistics.

? Issues ?
As Anil said, I?m not sure there?s much to be done about Issue Trackers and Task lists.

Since Sylvain is listed as Maintainer for a sub-domain he should already be on the infrastructure list :)

?Hi all,?

?I wanted to help but wasn't sure how to begin with. Based on comments here
I've added a list of all of the repositories currently within the ocaml/
organisation to an /infrastructure/ wiki page: https://github.com/ocaml/
infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories so we can easily see what is
there and where we might organise things.

The infrastructure wiki might be a good place to provide more of an
overview of the OCaml ecosystem, and not just machine resources. Some
ideas/questions:

* We can pin 6 of the main repositories to the OCaml organisation page as
per the Mirage organisation page: https://github.com/mirage

* The wiki: https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki is a little out of
date - perhaps we could refresh/reorganise it?

* Rather than migrating, we can link to other OCaml libraries that are
relevant to the core ocaml.org ecosystem such as
https://github.com/ocaml-doc, https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin that
are incorporated within their own organisations

* Shall we link to other third party libraries that are important/relevant
to the core compiler? e.g. Spacetime, AFL

?Thanks,

Gemma?

Dear all,

Thank you for all of your comments! To do a consolidated reply:

Good point.  It would be useful to clarify this scope though, since the governance doc makes several references to "code repositories" that are all hosted
in the GitHub ocaml/ org.  So it seems quite relevant to organise those code repositories under the same framework as the rest of the infrastructure that they eventually drive.

> I mention this in case anyone think it?ll be a trivial thing to add :)

What particular difficulties did you have in mind with extending it to cover the management of code?

Keeping a static copy of the existing Forge would be very useful. Regarding mass migration, I was thinking of simply git cloning the existing repositories into a mirror namespace on GitHub, and doing nothing further.  Individual maintainers from the Forge could then be granted write access and/or the repositories transferred if they choose, but at a minimum simply keeping a copy of code, history and tags would provide OPAM with a useful mirror alternative to the Forge.

If maintainers do want GitLab, they will have to host it themselves...

Thanks for jumping in here, Gemma!  To be clear, we ("infrastructure") welcome anyone who wishes to help maintain the growing set of repositories, so please do feel free to ask clarification questions about anything that is undocumented or otherwise confusing.

> Based on comments here I've added a list of all of the repositories currently within the ocaml/ organisation to an /infrastructure/ wiki page: https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories so we can easily see what is there and where we might organise things.

I've edited this to add some more information.  It would be good to have a short page about infrastructure on ocaml.org as well -- would you (or anyone else on the thread) have suggestions for where to put this on the website?  I'm keen to avoid wiki proliferation and have one place on ocaml.org where people can be directed to this kind of information.

Sounds good; how about:

ocaml
ocaml-manual
ocamlbuild
opam
opam-repository
ocaml.org

This covers the core compiler, OPAM and the website.

My fault I'm afraid. I'll take a pass a bit later on...

This is a very good point.  One of my concerns is that the various new features in OCaml are quite spread out now. Spacetime's implementation is on [either Leo or Jane Street] person repos, the ocaml-doc is its own organisation, and so on.

Would there be any objection to also starting discussions with various maintainers about migrating in "headline" projects such as Spacetime UIs into the ocaml/ org?  I'd suggest only doing this once the feature is in a released compiler distribution, since then the maintenance burden is established for some time.

Thanks again for all the rapid and helpful responses, Amir, Sylvain and Gemma.

regards,
Anil

I think it would fit best under Documentation.

ocaml-manual is obsolete, so we get to add another.

I've just pinned 4 to start with:
https://github.com/ocaml

ocaml
opam
opam-repository
ocaml.org

We can reserve two more for any headline projects that move into ocaml/.  For instance, it might be nice to have Merlin under ocaml/merlin, as it is very tied to the language and is the only such tool in the ecosystem.

Anil

Following the earlier thread, several more repositories have been moved to the ocaml/ organisation:

By Xavier Leroy:
zarith
num
dbm

By Fred Bour:
merlin

By Louis Gesbert / Anil Madhavapeddy:
opam-publish

A new team has been created for merlin-dev, and the rest re-use existing ones.

The full list is at:
https://github.com/ocaml/infrastructure/wiki/OCaml-Project-Repositories

regards,
Anil

Great! It's good to see that opam-publish is now under the ocaml
organization on GitHub.

It's not a big deal but I think you'll find that I, rather than you,
are the secondary author of opam-publish according to the opam
metadata and the commit history of the repository. Perhaps you were
thinking of opam-depext which is already under the ocaml organization?

Thanks,

David

You are indeed the secondary author :-) It wasn't clear from my original
email, but I was referring to who discussed the move, rather than who
authored the repositories.  Louis and I decided to move it in order to
make the process of publishing minor updates easier to open up
to a wider development audience, especially since we'd like the plugin
to become as widely used as opam-depext is now.

regards,
Anil
