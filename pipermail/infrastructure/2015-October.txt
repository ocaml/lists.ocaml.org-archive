Xavier informed us that  that caml.inria.fr will be down in Jan 2016 for 48
hours [1]. Just thought I'd mention it here, as it might affect
certain services like opam.

OCaml.org does still have links to that domain, but I don't consider it too
terrible for those links to be dead for a short period of time. (As a
reminder, all of caml.inria.fr is deprecated, except for caml.inria.fr/pub/*,
which continues to be the source of static content such as tarballs.)

Did some people talk to Damien Doligez, as OCaml release manager, about moving 
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/* to ocaml.org?

PS: Github now support git lfs[1] but I never tested this tools for managing big files in git.

I think the idea behind keeping /pub/ on caml.inria.fr is to
authenticate that a particular tarball is the official INRIA's
version, not a fork modified by the community. It does make sense for
me, although we could even limit INRIA's contribution to publishing
checksums for tarballs that would be hosted on ocaml.org.

Yes, this has been discussed with Inria. Xavier has told me they would
prefer to keep managing the pub/ directory on Inria's server. Given this is
all static content, storing in git wouldn't necessarily be a great choice
anyway (though we do have the ocaml.org-media repo for that purpose).

Okay, I mistakenly understood the following recent Xavier's comment[1] as the only drawback is for 
the release manager.

I just tested git-lfs (v1.0.0) and it works well on github.

Yes, ease for Damien was the explanation provided (recently and a few years
ago).

There is nothing to do with that, except perhaps the checksum idea.

On the other hand there is:

Which could be change by understanding the need of Damien and trying to fill them.

I will ask on devel to Xavier and Damien to know where they stand.

It is not terrible but, on the other hand, setting up a mirror may not be terribly difficult either and redundancy is always good. :-)

It is only of cosmetic benefit, yet by moving to ocaml.org:
  - we could always use this website instead of caml.inria.fr in the readme file, except for the 
bugtracker.
  - bts.ocaml.org could redirect to mantis. (NB: caml.inria.fr doesn't have https, unlike ocaml.org 
and mantis seems not uptodate "Copyright ? 2000 - 2011 MantisBT Group")
  - we could make `http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/` share the nice style of ocaml.org

It also marginally matters for TLS certificates -- we have a wildcard one for ocaml.org, and so could use that as a root of trust for code signing releases in the future.  Not sure if one exists for caml.inria.fr.

That would be nice, but it won't be automatic. The HTML would have to made
compatible with ocaml.org's CSS rules.

Subject: [ocaml-infra] Are user-modifiable OCaml snippets available on
	ocaml.org?
Message-ID: <CAPFanBH3Xx+AYxOjLBzc0BBg-8ZCm7XetAXvw2aRHZYYK0e8Yw@mail.gmail.com>

In #706 I remarked that the current "Basics" tutorial page is an
unsatisfying compromise between "a tour/taste of the language" and "basic
setup to try a few things", mixing presentation of language features with
advice to get code running.

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/706

Thinking more about the matter, I think this could be solved by having a
web widget that contains OCaml code (and the result) and the user can play
with. This allows to *both* present language features from a toplevel-like
interface, and let the user play with it without installation steps.

(An example of use of this feature would be the very nicely done "School of
Haskell" website:

https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/using-fphc/how-to-use-the-school-of-haskell/soh-markdown
)

I stay away from web development with a passion, so I'm mostly ignorant of
(1) how this could be executed (I would expect either TryOCaml or IOcamlJS
to be embedded somehow) and (2) whether this capability is actually
available today (and how to use it).

My question is actually three-fold:
- I'm asking for a feature I could use as a contributor to the website.
- If it exists, I would be interested in a documentation of this feature
(it may be that just the code of working example suffices).
- Because I was not able to know whether the feature exists, I think there
may be a need for a clearer place where to find this "website contribution
information". There is the README and http://ocaml.org/about.html , but
none of them quite seem to fit the bill.

Once the actual current status of this is clarified, I would be happy to
write issue reports for easier tracking. Thanks for the website work!

Yes, I believe those are the two options, though I'm also not very
knowledgeable about this. Both require a fair amount of extra work, either
another server and/or some additional amount of development. For example,
my efforts to use IOCaml first led to several bug reports. It's not
something that just worked. (The author is extremely responsive, so no
criticism here, but the point is it wasn't production ready when I last
tried it).

No, no such feature exists. The closest thing is the feature used in 99
Problems <https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html>. The source
<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/site/learn/tutorials/99problems.md>
for that page contains toplevel commands, which are auto-evaluated and
inserted into the HTML output.

Indeed there is no such page. The current instructions are basically
"freely edit pretty much any file under the site directory", but of course
there is more detail that could and should be provided. We currently have a
contributors <https://ocaml.org/contributors.html> page, which could be
reworked to "contributing", and a link could be added to the Contact
section in the footer and other places. I'm tracking in #713
<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/713>.
