For those who didn't jump the shark yet, here are a few steps to get a basic "mailing list mode" for topics that interest you and whose email experience I personally find mostly quite satisfying.

1. Create an account or login with your github/google id on https://discuss.ocaml.org/
2. Goto to your account preferences: click on your icon on the top right of the page and then on the cog icon. Click 
on the 'Preferences' button on this page.
2. Click on 'Emails" on the left menu.
3. In the "Email" section set "Include previous replies at the bottom of emails" to "Never" and untick "Include an excerpt of replied to post in emails" so that each email you get contains a single message.
4. In the "Mailing list mode" section tick "Enable mailing list mode".

To control what gets in your inbox go to https://discuss.ocaml.org/categories and click on a category of interest. On the page of the category the top right button next to the "New Topic" allows to control conditions of notifications (by default you never receive anything except if you are mentioned in the discussion). Exactly the same can be done at the level of tags (https://discuss.ocaml.org/tags) which span across categories. 

To get a bird's eye view of what you are following or bulk control over this go to your account preferences (see above) and click on the "Notification->{Category,Tags}" sub menus.

Filtering the notifications in your inbox can be done in bulk by matching on ocaml at discoursemail.com in the `From:` header, more precise filtering for categories can be done on `List-id:` header. 

HTH, 

Daniel
