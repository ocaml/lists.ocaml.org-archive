<PRE>Hi,

2012/12/6 Karl Ward &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">kw1213 at nyu.edu</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Sorry for the late response, it has been a busy few days, plus my laptop
</I>&gt;<i> is dying so I've been on borrowed computers while Apple refuses to
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge that my system has a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Puppet is great for system administration primarily because of the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation aspect.  Most routine operations (creating users, setting
</I>&gt;<i> passwords, installing software, starting services, configuring services)
</I>&gt;<i> can be done in a Puppet manifest.  The major benefit is that the act of
</I>&gt;<i> configuration becomes self-documenting.  You mentioned documentation of
</I>&gt;<i> system configuration as a separate step--yes, documentation is easy, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's usually the step that gets skipped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the need for a Puppet server, I agree that setting up a Puppet
</I>&gt;<i> server is not how you want to spend your time.  However, you don't actually
</I>&gt;<i> need a Puppet server at all.  Many large sites use Git or another repo
</I>&gt;<i> system to store the Puppet manifests, and instead of contacting a server,
</I>&gt;<i> each managed node looks at its own local copy of the Puppet manifests.
</I>&gt;<i>  Each node periodically does a repo pull and keeps its own copy up to date.
</I>&gt;<i>  The only central server involved is a repo, which you probably have
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.  This practice is pretty common at very large Puppet sites (I've
</I>&gt;<i> heard it is what Google uses, for instance).  We don't do this yet, but as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as we have nodes on a public cloud we will.  Using Git to distribute
</I>&gt;<i> Puppet manifests is described in one or more of the Puppet books, and a
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat old post about it is online here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bitfieldconsulting.com/scaling-puppet-with-distributed-version-control">http://bitfieldconsulting.com/scaling-puppet-with-distributed-version-control</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>True, one recommended way of doing puppet configuration is to have a github
repository and pull it directly on the node (+cron job). That is quite easy
to setup.

Concerning the usage of puppet itself, I think it is worth the effort, if
you have more than 2 instances to setup. I think ocaml.org will be more
than one instance.

The benefits are not immediate but the long term is better.

Although, when dealing with configuration setup, I strongly recommend using
Augeas. Setup a private github repository (server configuration should not
be public) and we can start putting thing here. I'll probably start with
configuration of the forge.ocamlcore.org instances, just as an example...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just yesterday, Karl offered to do pretty much anything for the ocaml.orginfrastructure if it somehow involved him working on a Rasberry Pi cluster.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've been playing around with Puppet this weekend at last, and I'm less
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> convinced we really need it.  I'm putting the mail server in a VM running
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Postfix, and it doesn't seem very necessary to have all the complexity of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Puppet itself when each of the services is essentially running just a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> single daemon (email or web or sync, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I'm inclined to revert back to the usual XenServer way.  Create a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Wheezy VM, add a dssh key to regularly apt-get update on all of them, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create clones in XenServer for each of the services.  This is pretty easy
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to back up and document.  We can still host your Puppet in a VM too, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not for the really important services like e-mail, which I'd prefer to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> keep configured in a simpler way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thoughts?
