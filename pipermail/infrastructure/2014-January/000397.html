<PRE>Wow, I wasn't aware of any of this!

That tutorials page is really incredible... just so much material (and in
different languages too!). And I'm really happy to see those wiki pages as
well. So I guess now there are... too many places to put material? I think
there has to be one centralized location for a thorough, wiki-like
repository.

The tutorials page looks excellent, although I have a feeling people just
aren't going to want to fork, edit, and then submit a push request. The
thing about wikis is that contributing takes minimal effort. Is it possible
to allow anyone with a github account to contribute to parts of the site
(as if it were a wiki?) Also, in a wiki, if you want to create a hierarchy
(ie. split off into sub-pages) at any point, you can easily do so. Is this
doable in the tutorial page? For example, I think it makes more sense to
have a page other than 'tutorials' as the topic for discussions such as
compiler internals and parallelism.

Regarding the existing wikis, how hard would it be to centralize
everything? I'm not so fond of the fact that there is one wiki for compiler
hacking, and one for ocaml internals. Wikis generally include everything on
a wide topic. So to me it would make more sense to have an 'ocaml' wiki,
with sub-categories for compiler hacking, internals, parallelism etc.

Any other opinions?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We do have a fledgling service for &quot;domain-specific&quot; conversations, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the form of lists.ocaml.org.  In fact, we set up a &quot;wg-parallel&quot; mailing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list last year, but never announced it for various reasons.  This seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like a good time to advertise its existence:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/">http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (note that if anyone else would like an archived list on lists.ocaml.orgfor a project or community group, then please do drop a line to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org</A> to request it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding other services on ocaml.org, we (the &quot;infrastructure team&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are happy to set them up, but please bear in mind that they all come with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintenance burden.  Dealing with security issues, backups, software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates, outages all take up time, and I confess a preference for sipping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> martinis and hacking on code instead of sysadmin work. Jeremy and Leo got
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tired of waiting for me to set up the wiki too, and started:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki">https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you follow the links through there, there is a 'compiler internals'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page that would be good to contribute to, and you (or anyone else) is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extremely welcome to add more information on topics such as parallel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programming libraries there.  I think we could have a decent stab at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wiki.ocaml.org by backing it against a GitHub repository, and not have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do any special hosting for it at all (the OPAM web pages work in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar fashion at the moment).  But for now though, I'd recommend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focussing on the problem at hand (parallel programming) and getting some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information down somewhere, and less on the lack of a central wiki.
