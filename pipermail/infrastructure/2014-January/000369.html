<PRE>OCaml offers multiple choices for doing things, and I hope that won&#8217;t change.
Choosing and advertising for a single editor or editor mode doesn&#8217;t sound good to me.
Therefore, I believe it wouldn&#8217;t harm the OCaml community to have some better place and visibility for Tuareg, which could well cohabit with some concurrent projects under the OCaml umbrella. Also I believe <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml">https://github.com/ocaml</A> is (at least now) a lot better place than {<A HREF="http://tuareg.forge.ocamlcore.org">http://tuareg.forge.ocamlcore.org</A> + <A HREF="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/tuareg/">https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/tuareg/</A> which are quite confusing, especially the former which seems even more deprecated than the latter}, especially since a lot of OCaml projects are now under <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/.">https://github.com/ocaml/.</A>

And since the OCaml distribution is being cleaned-up (isn&#8217;t it?), perhaps it&#8217;s also time to remove the emacs/*.el files from it, and put them somewhere else (perhaps under <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/">https://github.com/ocaml/</A> as well, I don&#8217;t really care).

Yes I&#8217;ll be happier if Tuareg moves to <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg/.">https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg/.</A>

&gt;<i> I hope this does not sound too negative, but I'm not sure we would gain by &quot;blessing&quot; tuareg as &quot;the&quot; ocaml editor mode for Emacs. The parallel existence of caml-mode and tuareg-mode has been a long-time annoyance of mine, because I don't see a strong justification for using either instead of the other. In particular tuareg has had long-standing bugs that are rather annoying, and I for one would be very happy to throw away any kind of elisp-implemented approximation of the OCaml syntax, and use a more principled approach such as Merlin+ocp-index to handle them (none of which currently support syntax highlighting iirc., but that could be added to ocp-index capabilities).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do think however that given the high number of Tuareg users, it is a very good thing that dedicated souls such as Christophe accept the pain of maintaining emacs modes. If he can be pleased by having tuareg repo under's the &quot;ocaml&quot; community umbrella, I see no strong reason why not -- only I won't recommend as strongly all of the software under the &quot;ocaml&quot; umbrella.
