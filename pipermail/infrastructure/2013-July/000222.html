<PRE>Dear all,

In addition to Amir's email (From: Amir Chaudhry &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">amc79 at cam.ac.uk</A>&gt;, Date: Thu, Jul 4, 2013 at 9:54 AM),
here are some details to help you understand where we're heading to.
Please feel free to comment on it.

(The text below uses markdown syntax and ASCII-based schemas, so it's best viewed using a markdown viewer but using a fixed-width font should be fine too.)

We're trying to  make the new ocaml.org website  as simple to maintain
and  build as  possible, in  the  sense that  one should  not have  to
understand the whole process in  order to intervene on a tiny specific
part of the website.
An example of how this might work is in the schematic below.

**We are not heading to  a website entirely written in OCaml.**
In  particular, pages  will be  written using  the  Markdown language,
which  is more  human-friendly than  HTML.  Where  needed, it  will be
possible to  use HTML, but parts  written in HTML  should almost never
change (that means that validation  of HTML should be easily done with
an external  tool).  The site being  mostly static is  the main reason
why we're not considering writing  the whole website using OCaml: it's
not worth the effort.  Indeed, having  to write some OCaml code is not
much  more  human-friendly  than  having  to  write  some  HTML  code,
especially compared to using Markdown.

Some Markdown files will be  written by humans, and some others partly
or entirely generated.   Any of them may contain  HTML parts.  We will
use tools  to allow the  generation of Markdown files  from &quot;enriched&quot;
Markdown files.   This means that  we may write special  directives in
&quot;enriched&quot;  Markdown files in  order to,  for instance,  include OCaml
code from existing  .ml files. We may also want  to include the result
of the compilation of some OCaml code.

In an enriched Markdown file, we may write, for instance
{{ format-ocaml &quot;ocaml -I blah&quot; foo.ml }}
and this would be replaced by the top-level's output when given the 
contents of the file foo.ml.

It could also be
{{ format-ocamlc &quot;ocamlc -I blah&quot;  foo.ml }}
and this would be replaced by the output of the ocamlc compiler.

This approach allows  the author of a page to have  control of how the
code  is  processed without  having  to  understand  the rest  of  the
transformation  chain (i.e., what  happens once  the Markdown  file is
produced). That has to be true for the entire website: not having to 
understand all of it seems to be crucial.

`[`Format of the source code`]`

`||`: Backbone (link to all components), yet to be precisely defined.

`{1}`: The  core of  the ocaml.org  website. It consists  of a  bunch of
Markdown and LESS files that are converted into HTML.

`{2}`:  The dynamic part  of the  ocaml.org website.  Dynamic components
should be written in OCaml. For instance, they may include a component
that, on the client side, fetches  a list of OPAM packages (e.g., most
recent ones) and prints it on the page.

`{3}`: A kind of richer version of `{1}` (so it does also use CSS/JS).
Tutorials,  and more  generally  exercises, are  Markdown files  which
include  at some  point some  OCaml code.   The OCaml  code  should be
processed in order  to be embedded into some  Markdown files; this can
be easily done using MPP. For instance, we can process the OCaml parts
in order  to have the  output given by  the OCaml compiler  (ocamlc or
ocamlopt)  or interactive  top-level  (ocaml). We  may  also embed  an
interactive   top-level  (e.g.,  TryOCaml)   and  make   the  examples
interactive and (locally) editable by the website visitors.


`[A]---conv---&gt;[B]`: Some  files written  using the A  language are
converted  by  some tools  (to  be defined)  into  files  using the  B
language. 
Pandoc may be used to convert Markdown files into HTML.
MPP may be used to (pre)process any textual file.
