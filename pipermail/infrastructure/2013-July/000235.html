I don't really like it (because I hate tar balls with generic names or hash-based names) but okay, I won't battle against it.

ok, that could lead to some &quot;funny&quot; programming style&#8230; ;-)

Sometimes you might want to create a tar ball of something that's been generated...

&gt;<i> Also, I'm not sure what you mean by put tarballs &quot;in the repo&quot;. I hope you won't do either of these things. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding.
</I>
Ok, until I change my mind, I won't put tar balls in the repo.

But to answer your question, here's a reason why I believe it can be relevant not to use github's archives.
Say I'm developing some software, and when I want to distribute it, (whatever my reasons) I don't want to distribute the whole thing or the way it is in the repo. So, I manually make packages when I want to distribute the software. 

It's one thing to have a public git repository to which anyone can &quot;pull request&quot;, and that's for developers who might want to contribute.
It's another to distribute software to people who want to use it and have no intention of contributing to it.
In the first case, it would likely be bad indeed to distribute something that has not been committed. But in the second case, I don't see the same problem.

For instance, a good motivation for distributing something that's different from the github repo is if parts of the end-user code are generated using a tool and you don't want to &quot;force&quot; your users to have that tool (but it's ok to &quot;force&quot; contributors to have it). For OMD, I have considered using MPP[1] to generate parts of it. If I do that, I don't want to force users of OMD to have MPP, so I would rather distribute preprocessed ml files. Does it make sense? or do you have a better way?

Cheers,
Philippe
