Folks, 

I seem to be having problems building ocaml.org locally.  None of the makefiles seem to have changed so I think this is a problem with my set up rather than the site (hence not filing a bug report).  

When I run `make` (or `make local`) in a fresh clone I get the following:

=======
ocaml.org amir$ make
cd script && \
	ocamlfind ocamlopt -package netstring -linkpkg -annot -g relative_urls.ml -o ../"script/relative_urls" && \
	rm -f relative_urls.o relative_urls.cmi relative_urls.cmx relative_urls.annot
/bin/sh: ocamlfind: command not found
make: *** [script/relative_urls] Error 127
ocaml.org amir$ 
=======

`make production` also fails but at the rss2html step.  I think this is something to do with the Path but I'm not clear on how to debug this further.  My uneducated guess would be something to do with the quote marks.

My opam switch is on 4.01.0 and I have the necessary packages installed (although I have `openssl` and `pkg-config` rather than `libssl-dev`).  Can anyone give me some suggestions as to what I should try next?

Best wishes,
Amir

I suggest you try this first:
opam install ocamlfind mpp omd ssl ocamlnet ocamlrss

Wild guess:  /bin/sh is being called and your "eval `opam config env`" is
in your .bashrc and in some way the $PATH is not being communicated

I've seen that before but I can't remember in which case (calling make from
vim inside tmux+ssh ... or alike :))

The first error indicates that `ocamlfind` is not found. Do you find that
in your path?

Yup, Philippe just IMed me to suggest the same:

eval `opam config env`

<tries some stuff>

Thank you both!  I've been able to track down the issue.  It was that my opam install didn't have the right files, specifically, `/.opam/opam-init/inith.sh` (which is what my `.bash_profile` calls).  Fixed by running `opam init` again and saying yes to modifying my files (it only had to update the files in the opam-init directory).

Thanks for the help!  I wouldn't have know where to look otherwise.

Amir :)

An additional note about how I probably gave myself this problem.

I sometimes update my opam install via `brew reinstall opam --HEAD`, after which I do the eval thing and then just carry on as normal.  My mistake is that I should also do `opam init` to make sure the scripts in the opam-init folder get updated.

Hi,

I owned the following domains:
ocaml.be
ocaml.eu
ocaml.fr

They will expire in 30/60 days. If some of you want to get them, just
tell me. I can transfer ownership.

Cheers
Sylvain
