Dear all,

a few days ago, I started playing with the new design of ocaml.org, so you can see now what it'll look like:
http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/

Some explanations and notes:
- a script takes the existing ocaml.org HTML files and converts them into this demo website.
- the list of all pages: http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/map.html
- since the upper horizontal menu doesn't contain the same elements, some links may point to menu.html (which might have disappeared by the time you read this email) 
- (almost) directly from the design firm, we have these pages:
http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/index.html (the version generated from the current ocaml.org is index-old.html)
http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/documentation.html
http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/platform.html

Best,
Philippe

Thanks Philippe!  To be clear, the current content on those sites is a strawman to work through the design issues, and not representative of the final content (e.g. the 'OCaml Book' will most certainly not just be RWO, but a collection of all the available books, as the current site has).

Feedback on the design would be most useful, as we can do a few iterations with the company that did the HTML/CSS/logo work and make sure we're all happy with the final result.  Personally, I love the new front page.

Hi,

Thanks for the work Philippe !

Maybe one can discuss first the front page.  Here are a few questions.

- Where should all the links of the current page go?  On sub-pages or 
may some of them (which ones) appear below "Learn",...?  If we move 
them to separate pages, what text must be put on the side of the four 
boxes?

- Do we want the top menu stay as it is or offer drop-downs?  The 
latter reduces the number of clicks but one may prefer to always land 
on the dedicated pages.

- Is the current distinction between more permanent news (managed by 
hand) and RSS feeds enough?  Also, one would certainly like to add 
"Preliminary program is available" under "OCaml 2013".

- Do we want a "Read more" button under "OCaml is an industrial..."?  
Or rather a "What is OCaml?" under "Learn"?

- In the "Packages" table, do we really want an "author" column?  The 
"Package" column is already not wide enough.  One could also think 
about putting in a tooltip the single line describing the package.  
Finally, I do not think OPAM has a "Category" field ATM.

My 0.02?,

Ocaml.org RSS feed on front page is broken. 
Reported by Heidi at https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/174

Wanted to point this out explicitly as it's right on the front page.
Is this some issue with RSS 2.2.2?

The error was right ;-)

The planet.ocaml.org stops responding around 00:35 and I have
restarted it at 7:30 (Zurich time). I got a mail from my hosting
provider but it was too late and I didn't see it.

The hosting of ocamlcore.org (which is the same as the one for
planet.o.o), is unreliable since a few months. We are working on
getting a new hosting with Anil.

I think you can close the bug, this was transient.

Regards
Sylvain

No, it occured before rss ? 2.2.2 was required.  I fixed it.

Yes, the content is up for discussion.  

It's currently a mixture of things from the current site (community contributed content) and some of the things I toyed with during the wireframing.  The 'books' section should definitely be the covers of books people can read but at the time I put the mockups together, I only put RWO in.  It'd be better off as a carousel of all the book covers.

I personally prefer no dropdowns since it's more usable on touch devices.  Nothing more annoying than trying to get a dropdown working on a tiny iPhone!

Or have the "Learn More" below the "Download" link, perhaps?

I agree that the Author field isn't needed.

It might be helpful to play with the interactive wireframe demo (link below) to see how content is laid out.  In order to make the site easier to navigate, there'll be additional 'landing pages', which is where the new headings will point to.  The links (and content) will be put on those pages.  The text on the side of the images will be descriptive.  See http://git-scm.com for an example.

In general, the aim of the front page is to be a lot cleaner and make it easier for people to figure out what content they're after and demonstrate that the OCaml community is an active one.

I'm against drop-down lists.  They're really really difficult to navigate from mobile devices.

> - Is the current distinction between more permanent news (managed by hand) and RSS feeds enough?  Also, one would certainly like to add "Preliminary program is available" under "OCaml 2013".

This is something that I'd consider to be a new 'news' story and would be a bookmarked story (replacing the previous one).  Anything more than that starts to feel complicated with not much gain.  Do you feel differently?

> - Do we want a "Read more" button under "OCaml is an industrial..."?  Or rather a "What is OCaml?" under "Learn"?

This is probably a good idea but I'm extremely wary of adding too many links on the front page.  The more links there are, the less likely I feel anyone is to click them.  Having said that, a 'read more', or something like it, does make sense for the intro paragraph.

> - In the "Packages" table, do we really want an "author" column?  The "Package" column is already not wide enough.  One could also think about putting in a tooltip the single line describing the package.  Finally, I do not think OPAM has a "Category" field ATM.

I'm perfectly happy to drop the Author column in the package list, and probably Category too (I can't remember when/why I added that - I was probably thinking of tags, which we do want).  I'm expecting this table to be fairly easy to iterate on so I'm not too concerned about it at the moment (just as long as it exists)

This is great. I'm excited about the new design! Few comments:

* Should the categories Learn, Platform, etc. have their links right on the
front page? It is one extra click if you first have to click Learn, and
then get to a landing page, and then click something else. On the other
hand, the current design is cleaner.

* On my mobile phone, the drop down menus currently get converted to an
easy to scroll menu/sub-menu list. It seems to work quite well, so I don't
see the problem. Having the drop down menus would resolve the above point.
You get both a clean design and quick access to sub-menu items.

* The new design is less space efficient than the current one. The fonts
are bigger and there is more whitespace. Is that good? I tend to like
seeing more content in a given amount of screen space.

Two or three cents also... :)

- I like the colors and the modern overall look
- the alignments of the blocs look much better also
- but there are some things that I really prefer the current ocaml.org:
   - the smaller font and the more dense design with more info and less
clicks (and hence less long and painful HTTP requests)
   - the smaller top banner, with the dropdown menus (they work very nicely
on my mobile, I don't understand all the hate)
- the new logos "learn", "doc", etc look good but are really huge also,
they make the interface look a bit "Playskool"

I think http://git-scm.com is a bad example: who ever goes to that website?
(been using git for 5 or 6 years now, don't remember ever finding anything
there)

thanks & cheers!

I've got to say that the tiny font is one of my pet hates about the current OCaml theme.  The first thing I do is to crank it up to a default size.

However, this may be one of the areas where it's worth deferring to the opinions of a professional designer and not attempting to get consensus on.  I won't be surprised if half of us love the small font, and half of us hate it!

Fair point.  The new Scala site is quite fun, and doesn't pack in too much info in one page:
http://www.scala-lang.org

However, if we were to put a red dot where OCaml started, I don't think that the Rocquencourt barraks are nearly as scenic as Lake Geneva, sadly :-)

Isn't Paris considered one of the most beautiful cities of all time. But
actually, I don't like a photo background. It's nice at first but
eventually distracting.

Unfortunately, in my opinion and experience, getting to Rocquencourt when you're in Paris is a far worse experience than getting to Cambridge when you're in London.

I quite like the new design. A small note, though, the footer does not really follow the current design standard (you want to put the sitemap in there).

http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/07/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/

and there are plenty of similar designer rants on font small size.

The first page on the website should be light and easy, the primary target is people curious about OCaml, not experimented users (you should go to a different hub for that I guess).

I believe the new design has been done with the intention to *attract people*, instead of risking to scare them (or their eyes) away with loads of text, especially when it concerns the home page.

These days, people are (unfortunately) getting more and more used to reading a very little (cf. tweets!) unless they are already interested (in which case they keep reading "long texts", e.g., news or books).
It's a general tendency to place the contents for the eyes to easily find their way (even when actually it's all pretend). 

I will admit that I find it more practical when there's more contents on a web page, but that happens only when I know what I'm looking for: I do use the web browser's search function a *lot*. That being said, I'm convinced that a not overloaded page would be far better for the OCaml community's reflection.

Best,
Philippe

A few comments. 

* Though in general I find it quite balanced. I would also be in favor of a little bit more information density and less huge childish icons on the landing page. 

* To really have a good assessment of the design we need the real content, not Lorem [1]. 

* I already made my comments on the font of the new logo here [2]. It's even worse when put in context, it hurts my eyes. Oh and could you put a high-resolution image of the icon it's all blurry on a high resolution display.

* Packages, unless you can find an accurate metric for what a popular package is, I suggest to drop that "Most popular" tab. I mean from a programming point of view knowing that ocamlfind is the most popular package is a little bit useless (cf. opam's website). 

* I confirm the views from upper Montreux on Lausanne are as stunning as suggested by Scala's website. Feel free to drop by my place if you pass in the area. Can't speak for Roquencourt's baracks though. 

Best,

Daniel

So I suppose you're against being a "fashion victim". ;-)
I think it would make OCaml feel more modern if the web page was modern as well, for that I think it's important to follow the trend and to use modern design.

> * To really have a good assessment of the design we need the real content, not Lorem [1]. 

Yep, somehow I do agree. :-/

That one, I guess I couldn't formulate it before. I really dislike that font.

Philippe

Sure, but so called "modern" design doesn't necessarily imply good design. Good design is long lasting. And if it needs to be trendy don't follow the trend, set it.

It's only useless if you already know what ocamlfind is, otherwise its

Not really. That thing is likely going to be installed at the first `opam install pkg` invocation. So I don't need that useless popularity tab to tell me that it exists.

Why not but anything that has number of downloads in the equation is going to be flawed.  

The very idea of trying to measure "popularity" (whatever that means) seems wrong and misleading to me. I don't see any of this automatic pseudo popularity crap in other package systems. Besides it's not because a package is not often downloaded that it's not popular, it may be very popular to a narrow demographics. It's not because a package is often used by other packages that it's good or means that you should use it, it may be due to legacy reasons, etc., etc

Best,

Daniel

So rename the tab to "Most downloaded" then.

Would be better. But still showing a flawed metric. I'd simplify the design and remove it altogether. I think there could be another page with, more useful, fun and non flawed statistics, like package inter dependencies and things like that.

Knowing that (almost) all packages use ocamlfind is useful information
for a beginner who may want to create their own packages.

The important thing is to create the appearance of an active and vibrant
community. A most popular/most downloaded tab quickly gives you an
idea of the number of people using OCaml. It also shows that there are
established libraries with many users, which is particularly important
for a language with a negligible standard library.

I completely agree.  I do think it should be "most downloaded" and not
"most popular", as the latter is a somewhat loaded term.

Lately I realised that there are actually two markdown render engines on github: the one that is officially "GFM" (github flavoured markdown), which is used for issues, comments and pull requests, and the other one, which is somehow closer to standard markdown, that is used to render .md files in repos when you click on them (e.g., any .md file in https://github.com/pw374/sandbox/).

So I've decided that by default, omd should do standard markdown newlines, not GFM's.

I think this is a good decision.  Line breaks should not be enforced
for HTML paragraphs as these need to resize well according to the
browser width, font size,...  Moreover, since links will take more
space in Markdown than in HTML, it would be cumbersome to format
paragraphs well if newlines were transformed into <br/>.

While I am at it, I remember that "extension points" were evoked.
They are required IMHO if one wants to attach some code to the
transformation Markdown ? HTML.  For example, if one wants to have a
paragraph or a block of code initially hidden (with a button to make
it visible).  Is there any design for this ATM?

Best,
C.

At this moment (it took me a while to figure out what ATM meant), 
there is no design for what you mention.

This is not standard, but very useful when you can tweak the associated CSS, and I'd be very happy if I can add it later to your parser without too much trouble.

Well, eventually omd will parse an extended version of Markdown. Although the code (at least currently) is not very pretty (mainly because it's still the first iteration), I believe it is (already) **very** simple to understand how it's built in order to add one's own extension. Slightly modifying an existing behaviour might not be so trivial.
What I mean is that, if one wants to add a construction such as 
@@foo@@
which would be the equivalent of
<span class="foo">This is a useless extension of Markdown</span>
it's trivial (mainly thanks to OCaml pattern matching).
If one wants to slightly change the parsing of lists, it might be causing headaches?
If one wants to completely rewrite the parsing of lists, well, it will still cause headaches but that would not be because of existing code.

A note: I'm not really sure for the moment, as omd is not fully implemented yet, but I think omd is at least 10 times faster than pandoc (without even making any effort at all in that direction). :-)

Christophe, is your example referring to things like the 99 problems page [1, 2], where there are problems posed and clicking a button reveals the solution.  I'm not clear why this would be relevant to the Markdown implementation as html in the markdown file should be fine.  

Am I missing something?

The 99 problems page is what I was indeed thinking of.  Of course one 
 can always resort to HTML in case of need but I think that one shoul 
d take opportunity of the "port" of the page to Markdown to do someth 
ing better.  In particular, the text should be closer to the intended 
 semantics if possible, e.g., say

     @Question
     ...
     @Solution
     ...
     @Examples
     ...
     @end

possibly with a line "@use Questions" at the beginning of the file if 
 it is deemed desirable to announce explicitly the active extensions  
for a given page.  I think such an extension mechanism is desirable?? 
??? because it uses the principle of least surprise (syntax wise): on 
ce you read the documentation of the markdown parser, you know what c 
onstructs refer to outside code.  Otherwise, one may always preproces 
s Markdown files (adding HTML) before passing them to the parser but  
several incompatible extensions may appear (I'll certainly develop on 
e for ocaml.org).

Note that such an extension mechanism may also solve the specificatio 
n of metadata at the beginning of the file (such as "@use template ma 
in").

The possibility of adapting the output of standard elements would als 
o be desirable.  What if you want to add an anchor to each paragraph  
or add some JavaScript around each code block?

These kind of extensions are really best done using a template engine
before the conversion of markdown to HTML. Template engines are designed
to support such extensions, and mean you don't need to pollute your
markdown converter with support for arbitrary syntax extensions.

I think the plan is to build a simple template engine (similar to
mustache, handlebars or liquid) using mpp, and then use that to do the
preprocessing.

Hi Christophe

maybe that pre- or post- processing is meant to rely on MPP, another
project of Philippe's :) ?

Message-ID: <EEEE1E91-0200-46AE-BB36-A766786C46D7@cl.cam.ac.uk>

Dear all,

unless I have forgotten some features, I think I have just finished implementing a whole Markdown to HTML converter, with original specs [1] in mind.

Well, actually, some paragraph features are still missing (and it's intentional), such as paragraphs in lists? (for the moment I really don't care about this particular trait of markdown).

I have done very little testing on omd, so it might still have plenty of bugs, so I'm starting a testing phase now. So, very soon I shall make a release :-)

If you want to try it out, your feedbacks will be welcome. Note that for the moment, the binary doesn't parse its arguments, so it's all about stdin and stdout.

Best,
Philippe

N.B. I'll probably add a table of contents extension, eventually.

Sorry I forgot to put a reminder of the link to omd :
https://github.com/pw374/omd

I should seize the opportunity to say that one simple way to try it would be:
git clone https://github.com/pw374/omd
cd omd/src
make
./omd 
enter some markdown

Great!

I advise you again to look at https://github.com/samoht/ocaml-cow/tree/WIP/lib_tests/md if you are looking for some tests.

> If you want to try it out, your feedbacks will be welcome. Note that for the moment, the binary doesn't parse its arguments, so it's all about stdin and stdout.

If you want to make everybody happy, the simple 'extension point' mechanism is to add a way to add HTML tags to some word/paragraph (and a way to load css & javascript files in the generated HTML file). I've never seen any markdown engine doing this, but that would be incredibly useful (at least for me).

One idea for the syntax could be:

```
[ ... some markdown ... ]
[foo[
[ ... some markdown ... ]
]]
[ ... some markdown ... ]
```

which can be translated into:

```
[ ... some HTML ... ] 
<span class="foo">
[ ... some HTML ... ]
</span>
[ ... some HTML ...]
```

An other idea is to malformed HTML fragments when a line starts by '<':

[... some markdown ... ]
<span class="foo">
[ ... some markdown ... ]
</span>
[... some markdown ... ]
```

(which will be translated to the same HTML fragment as above)

You can even be brave and hack your parser to accept the one-line:

```
[ ... some markdown ... ] <span class="foo">[ ... some markdowm ...]</span> [ ... some markdown ... ]
```

Which will be translated to:
```
[ ... some HTML  ... ]<span class="foo">[... some HTML ...]</span> [ ... some markdown ... ]
```

Not sure which idea is best, though, it's really depends if you want to be compatible with other markdown engines.

Hi folks,

Thanks for the useful discussion!  I've tried to collate my responses here rather than replying to the individual emails.  I've tried to cover all the points but please let me know if I missed anything.


## OCaml logo

It's taken a while but I've heard enough comments (from a variety of people) that they really don't like the lettering on the new OCaml logo [1].  I don't recall anyone stepping forward to say they love it.  

As such, I'll take this aspect of it back to the design agency to reconsider and I'll start a *separate thread* to ensure I've got up-to-date feedback.  

Thank you for voicing your opinions. I'm very grateful.  It's difficult to please everyone but for the logo, we should try and avoid things that people strongly dislike.  I'm expecting it to be around for quite a while so it's important that people in the community are willing to use it. :)

[1] https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos


## Pages on the demo site

Please note that there *are* actual pages to look at e.g the 100 lines of OCaml [2] and tutorials page [3].  Just click on some of the links at [4].  These are not the final versions (in terms of styling) but I'm a bit concerned that people might only be commenting on the front page and nothing else.

[2] http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/taste.html
[3] http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/tutorials
[4] http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/menu.html

### On use of Lorem ipsum

There's only lipsum on the new pages that will help visitors find their way to the deeper content (e.g landing pages for the main menu items).  I made an effort to come up with initial headings so the only lipsum is body text.  The problem with lipsum is that the visual look of the page is altered when you replace it with actual text.  Things like word length and line-breaks affect the overall 'balance' of the content, which can sometimes be troublesome.  Having gone through that once before on other projects, I'm already aware of the issue.

Despite that, I disagree that we need proper text to assess the design.  If it doesn't work with lipsum, then adding text will *not* miraculously save it.  Using lipsum this way also gives you a feel of whether there is too much text, i.e. I now think the platform page has too much [5] and that's only around 70 words per paragraph.

[5] http://philippewang.info/CL/new-ocaml.org-demo/platform.html


### On drop-down lists

I'm really really not keen on drop down lists.  I can understand why they're useful but in my mind this is a website, not a user application.  As such, I do not think they belong in the primary navigation bar.  

Using drop-downs also makes an implicit assumption about the visitors, which is that they already know what they're looking for and where it lives. I don't agree with this assumption (of course, everyone here *does* already know the site, but there are many more people out there who do not).

You can look back at the Scala site [6], mentioned earlier in this thread, and see that they also avoid drop-down navigation lists.  So do a lot of web-apps that I'm familiar with.  

Please also bear in mind that most web-users find their way to content via search engines.  We shouldn't assume that all content is discovered by travelling from the first page onwards, hence I don't consider 'click-depth' to be a relevant metric.  That's fine for a collection of categorised bookmarks but we're aiming higher for the public face of our language.

An alternative, already mentioned, is to have more info in the footer.  I think this a good suggestion which could be done sensibly and avoid crowding the main navigation, though I'd think carefully about which links to put there (it shouldn't be everything).  Suggestions welcome :)

[6] http://www.scala-lang.org


### On the use of white-space and density

This is related to comments above.  *Reducing* the density of content and effective use of white-space makes things easier to navigate (there's less to mentally process before making a decision). 

This is also why larger fonts are better for the website.  When you know your way around something you appreciate density and the ability to see more at once e.g. think about the font sizes you use in your terminal windows or favourite editors - environments you've likely customised and are *highly* familiar with.  The same approach isn't appropriate for a website, where the audience covers a wide range and aims are different.

Having said the above, I do agree that the icons are a little large but they break up the page well.  I haven't made up my mind about the 'learn' and 'platform' icons but I do think we should have them. The navigation bar is also a bit too large and I'd like the news section to be a more prominent.  I'm wondering whether changing the first row to a four-column layout may be better.


## Package information

I completely agree that 'popular' is a misnomer.  'Most downloaded' makes way more sense. I did find the list useful when I saw it in OPAM as I had no idea that so many things depend on ocamlfind.  Of course, now that I have that knowledge, that particular tab wouldn't be much use to me (as the content wouldn't change much), but that doesn't mean it should be dropped altogether.

I do like the idea of a more detailed page elsewhere that shows more stats from opam e.g dependencies, (meta)data from OCamlot, etc. but they're not necessarily front-page items.


## Aside: Good designs last forever?

Designs change.  I'd argue that logos last a long time but that's because there's usually lots of investment and brand recognition attached to them.  Think about the Coca-cola and McDonald's logos.  

That good *brands* can stand the test of time should not be confused with good *design* somehow being unchanging.  

Best wishes,
Amir

That's not what was said. What was said is "it's not because it works with lipsum that it will work with the content" hence it's better to check the design with the real content, for the reasons you mention yourself.
  
> *Reducing* the density of content and effective use of white-space makes things easier to navigate (there's less to mentally process before making a decision).


This is wrong in general. It highly depends on how you define "easier to navigate", especially easier for *who*, e.g. recurring visitor vs casual one, etc. Besides reducing the density may imply scrolling and inability of seeing all the options at the same time. But sure, there's a tradeoff and the right balance has to be found.  

> I completely agree that 'popular' is a misnomer. 'Most downloaded' makes way more sense. I did find the list useful when I saw it in OPAM as I had no idea that so many things depend on ocamlfind.
  
Note that this is not what this number tells you, reasoning with a flawed metric implies flawed inferences. A more reliable way of asserting your proposition is to consult the "required by" field on this page:

http://opam.ocamlpro.com/pkg/ocamlfind.1.3.3.html
  
> ## Aside: Good designs last forever?

Stricly speaking long lasting <> lasts forever, but to exemplify there are many pieces of industrial design made around the middle of the last century that don't look outdated at all. Some of these things even made it in many people's pockets these days, see for example the iphone calculator (braun ET66 calculator) or the ipad clock (swiss railways clock).

> Designs change.
Fashionable designs change.

Daniel

Why not show a random list of packages, rather than always the same
short list of most downloaded (which can make them stay the most
downloaded).

Reducing the number of options reduces the cognitive burden in figuring out where to go next (I experienced this myself on my first visit). I think this is important if we want to encourage more folks to try/use OCaml. It places constraints on the amount of info we put there and I want to *avoid* the case where there are lots of options. Again, I'm talking about the front page specifically.

Obviously, the question is for everyone and even though it's not particularly scientific, anecdata has its uses.

How is it misleading when ocamlfind *is* the most downloaded package in opam? Or are you disputing that?

I am genuinely interested in discussing the design examples further with you, preferably in person. We should probably keep it off the list though.

Amir's approach is one of pipelining instead of serialising the design process.  Exposing the design early lets us find initial "oh no!" portions that must be corrected immediately. For instance, it's apparent that the logo font has no real fans, and we should get some more designs commissioned to explore alternative sooner rather than later.

While there have been comments on the rest of the design, there have been no real strong objections about the overall layout, so proceeding to the next phase when the content gets filled in makes sense.

Filling in the lorem ipsum is something that obviously needs to happen, and some real work has (is) happening to fill in the blanks there, at which point it'll be easier to refine the design more.  Let's treat this as an iterative process and not get bogged down in side debates about design philosophy while that happens...

I suppose Daniel point about ocamlfind is that it is misleading to
think that it is popular because it ranks high due to the number of
reverse dependencies on it.

In Debian packaging system there is a slight difference between
packages that you install yourself (we say they are manually
installed) vs packages which are installed to fullfill dependencies.
We use that to purge packages using "apt-get autoremove" and get rid
of packages we don't have manually installed.

Although, I think this is not misleading because a package that is a
dependency of every other packages is a good tip to say that maybe you
should consider using it. At least from a dev point of view, it is
worth considering.

Cheers
Sylvain

Presenting this information leads you to misleadling *conclusions*, superbly witnessed by the semantic slip that has been made from (not only inaccurate) download count to popularity. Good analytical design should *inform* you (lead you to scientifically correct conclusions), not *mislead* you.
  
> Or are you disputing that?

What I'm disputing is the general trend among programmers of using crap metrics/data to derive crap inferences that lead to flawed conclusions. It is my hope that a website presenting OCaml can get over those gimmicks and have intellectually satisfying content.

Daniel

I think I have fixed what was missing (well, obviously I had forgotten a few features).

Thanks, they have been very useful (in making me not sleep last night).
Two questions: 
1. is there a license? (I think they are already in my repo, Jeremy added a bunch of test files and I think that they're the same)
2. in url-with-parenthesis.md there is 
There's an [episode](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Darmok_(episode)) of Star Trek: The Next Generation
How do you end up with a URL that includes the first closing parenthesis? It is because you count the number of opening parentheses in the URL? Or does it naively take the farthest one before a space or newline or end-of-file?

Oh, I've just seen that it's the last test? It means I've almost finished the 1st testing pass.
I'll have to at least make a 2nd pass to check that I haven't broken anything while fixing other things.
Well, there's already that "paragraphs in lists" I have to fix. I don't quite understand the point in Markdown generating so many paragraphs...

The challenge is that we're building a site targeting multiple groups. I
accept that the front page should aim to attract new users (although I
think a footer with a sitemap could help those of us wanting quick access
too). Many other pages are for experienced users. For reference, here is
the June google analytics report [1]. Unfortunately, it just confirms the
challenge. Returning Visitors and New Visitors constitute an exact 50/50
split of our visitors.

Hi all,

some news for omd:

- omd has suffered from having to pass a lot of tests? oh wait, no, omd is fine, I'm the one who's suffered. Well, omd works much better now.
- I think all core features work fine (as always, it still needs more testing)
- thanks to Christophe, omd can be built using oasis and it should be in opam soon (using oasis2opam)
- if you don't have oasis installed, it's not a problem, there is a Makefile in src/ to build omd without oasis (well, it needs you to have ocamlopt.opt or ocamlc.opt, if you don't, install them or edit the Makefile and remove the .opt suffix)

If you have some time, please try omd on your markdown files and send me bug reports if any.

Best,
Philippe
