Dear ocamlweb list members,

You may have noticed there's been lots of activity on the ocamlweb project
recently [1], and changes are being pushed to ocaml-lang.org hourly. There
is lots of work to do still, which we're tracking with github's Issue
system [2]. Feel free to take one on, or just give feedback on how the site
looks so far. Your input in any form will be greatly appreciated.

[2] https://github.com/agarwal/ocamlweb/issues

Cheers. And see you at OUD.

Subject: [ocamlweb-devel] ocamlweb updates
Message-ID: <CAMu2m2L+bv3SXzCQ9c6SOJRiUxYBcK4Egj3uKx8Fi657fY_iuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ocamlweb-devel list,

Here are some quick updates:

* I gave a short demo of the site at OUD, which was well received.

* Xavier Leroy has agreed to allow hosting it on the ocaml.org domain. This
is very good news and makes the site more official. We are working to
import content from the current Inria site (much is already done, and there
are open Issues marking each item remaining).

* The ocaml repo has been moved to https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org. This
makes it more official and less tied to any particular individual.

* We are working on a permanent hosting solution. Once setup, we'll be able
to point ocaml.org to this new server.

As always, your contributions are welcome, and now you can be confident
that your work will benefit the community by going directly onto ocaml.org.

Best,
Ashish

Subject: [ocamlweb-devel] social networking
Message-ID: <CAMu2m2KuDChgiMOPkOJthyDNJ==MFkpvZ0TD9_vaHYW-MgAWFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ocaml.org developers,

I've created facebook [1] and twitter [2] accounts for us to use. I'm not
particularly adept at using either. Please let us know if you have good
ideas for how to make use of these assets. One idea is to add a "share to
twitter/facebook" link on select areas of the new site.

[1] http://www.facebook.com/groups/ocaml
[2] https://twitter.com/ocamlorg

It would be nice to consolidate ownership of these various accounts under
some responsible authority, e.g. the new OCamlLabs. Right now many of the
good names have been taken, are unused, and we don't know who owns them (if
you do, please let us know). Examples of accounts we should put to good use
are:

Github: "ocaml" organization. This luckily is in the hands of Anil and is
now being properly used.

Google: Would be nice to use the accounts "ocaml.org", "ocamlorg", or
"ocamlweb" (in order from highest to lowest preference), but I haven't
succeeded yet in finding out who owns them. Note "ocaml" would be the best
option, but that is not a valid google user name. The best we could get
right now is "ocamlwebsite", not great but not horrible. Esther has started
organizing videos on the associated youtube account.

Facebook: We now have the "ocaml" group, which is perfect. Surprisingly
this was not already taken. That just shows how far behind we are in using
social networking to promote OCaml.

Twitter: We now have the account @ocamlorg. I would prefer to use @ocaml,
but this is already taken (and unused). Note @ocaml.org is not a valid
Twitter name.
