Doesn't that just push the source template / content data, rather than the
compiled HTML you get after running "make"?

Ah didn't see this message, and didn't realise the generated pages made it
to github. How does that work?

Incidentally, I am going to be back in the UK, a few hundred yards from
the Computer Lab on Friday; if someone based there could spare me a few
minutes of time to discuss how "drive by" contributions could be made
easier, it'd be much appreciated.

Anyway, I think a move to Markdown would be very good from the perspective
of widening the base of contributors of content. I've just migrated
fifteen years of HTML cruft in my personal website to Markdown, with
remarkably little hassle; what this revealed was that a couple of items
couldn't be conveniently supported by Markdown - I expect ocaml.org has
its own, such as the 99 exercises code.

Definitely; I'll take this off-list.

Agreed. We've had pretty good success with writing most of Real World OCaml
in Markdown, with some OCaml scripts to massage the resulting DocBook and
other output formats.

The trick is to make gh-pages an orphan branch:
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually

You then push the compiled site to this branch. See the 'publish' target in
the Makefile. You'll want to do almost the same thing, with a few changes:

* Skip the first 2 steps. These make sure I'm publishing the latest commit
on the 'publish' branch in the master repo. Since you'll be experimenting,
you'll want to compile whatever local commit you're on.

* In the clone step, change the URL to your own fork.

Maybe we should add a 'publish-dev' target that does this, but we'll have
to decide how to set the URL to your personal fork.

That's exactly the page I'd like to see tested under Markdown because it is
the most likely to be problematic. On the other hand, you can simply
include html when needed, so there's always a fallback.

Ok, but this entails having the Ocaml toolchain installed on your
internet-facing server. Mine (which runs Debian squeeze) didn't have this.
It took literally 25 minutes to get all the necessary stuff (a recent
Ocaml compiler, opam, oasis, etc) installed before I could run "make" in
the ocaml.org directory.

That's probably enough effort to deter at least some potential
contributors.

I'm not following. You need OCaml to compile the site, which is simply your
dev machine. You don't need any server.

I do if I want to get other people's feedback on the compiled site, before
sending a pull request. As you note, I could instead use an orphan branch
and use github as a server, at the cost of doing the compilation manually
on my dev machine, which is fine by me, but feels like it's the wrong way 
round.

If compiling a dev version of the site is really so onerous, we could make it one of the staging tasks in the OCamlot bot to compile and push to a staging site.

It doesn't seem too hard to just run a one-off OPAM installation though.

It's not onerous for me - but it is certainly more onerous than a site
which is pure markdown and which just needs to be pushed, as the markdown
compile is done on the post-receive hook server-side.

Not hard at all, given that it's just cut-n-paste into the shell, but it
took 25 minutes to download and compile all the bits.

This is probably too minor a point for us all to be discussing in such
detail! :)

Jekyll's easy because Github has an installation already -- but not so easy
if you have custom plugins, alas!

Yep -- this should all get easier as a matter of course as binary packages
show up for the various new tools such as OPAM.  There are even some plans
afoot to support binary snapshots of OPAM builds, to make deployments in
cloud services easier.

For now though, content is king :)

I see, so you do want to avoid compilation entirely. That would be nice,
but that'll be harder to provide and I'm not sure it's worth it. Most
people willing to commit a change to ocaml.org probably have OCaml
installed. They might not have a few dependencies like Weberizer and
ocamlrss, but installing those just takes a few seconds. I can see this
still deterring people who want to make small contributions, e.g. fixing a
spelling error. However, then you probably don't care to share a compiled
dev version of the site. That'll only be useful if you're making larger
design changes.

Seems like you're thinking of something more like Jekyll?
That works well for GitHub pages but custom scripts are turned off, presumably for security (you can't execute your custom code on their machines).  That's fine for simple blog sites but not for anything complex (though people have put together other tools for that [1]).  Any staging server would have the same concern so this isn't really Markdown specific.

Even in the case of a Jekyll site, if you wanted other people to look at your changes first, you'd still have to have either (1) push it to another github repo where their jekyll installation would run or (2) run jekyll locally and put the www files on a server somewhere.  In other words, the steps are largely the same.  For ocaml.org, I agree that there is a lot to download and run before you can get to the point of running `make` but we may be able to make that more streamlined over time.

Not at all! I found this exchange pretty useful in terms of understanding what someone was trying to achieve.  Thanks for the comments :)
