Hi

Could you create a new mailing list named

wg-windows

to discuss the status of OCaml and its ecosystem on Windows. I would be
happy to act as a moderator for the list. Once the list is created, I will
take care of announcing its creation on the caml-list mailing list.

Best,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Absolutely.  The list wg-windows has been created, and you are the list administrator (and should have received the password).  You can administer it at to customise moderation and so on before announcing it.
http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-windows <http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-windows>

Admin interface:
http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/wg-windows/general <http://lists.ocaml.org/admin/wg-windows/general>

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Anil
