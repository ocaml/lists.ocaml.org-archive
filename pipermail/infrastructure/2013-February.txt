Subject: [ocaml-infra] OCaml.org design work
Message-ID: <4BF2F63E-2324-461E-BD3D-23FEC3FD4964@cam.ac.uk>


Dear all,

We're starting work on the OCaml.org design project.  We're working with a professional design agency in Cambridge so this is to give people an overview of what's happening. The people working directly with the firm are me, Ashish, Christophe and Anil.  We'll be keeping everyone up to date with progress via this list and on the relevant OCaml Labs page [1].  Just as an additional note, this is the same agency Anil and I worked with to get the Real World OCaml website done [2].


-- Overall goals of the website --

One of the first and important points the design firm raised was who the site is for.  Admittedly, this isn't a direct design question but it's important that the design firm understands what we're trying to achieve so that we get the result we want.

Overall, the site is meant for 'the community' but in more practical terms I broke that down as follows:

1 - It must be useful to current OCaml users
2 - It needs to be a place those current users can point others to for info/updates
3 - It needs to be useful for the wider group of casual visitors/newbies/community

My reasoning for the above is as follows.  The core group (current users) must find utility from the site or there's less drive for them to visit or contribute.  When those users get something useful from the site, then they're more likely to remember to point others to it.  Once the first two groups are catered for then the site starts becoming useful to the wider crowd of people who are generally interested and find their way to the site themselves.

Of course, I'm happy for feedback on the above and I expect that others have already thought about such things.  I had a quick look at previous mailing-list archives but didn't find anything obvious regarding website goals.


-- Timelines --

We've mentioned that we need final design/templates by April and this will be an iterative process.  The reason for this is to tie in with the Platform and book launch but if either of those is pushed back then we'll consider how we want to proceed.  The firm should be getting started this week and we have a fixed quote for a specific amount of time (OCaml Labs is covering the cost of the work).


-- Deliverables --

The design firm is aware of the following:
    - We want to use the bootstrap grid
    - Ashish and Christophe have done a lot of work to date on design, content and information architecture
    - We're doing more work on an OCaml logo

I've asked them initially to think about mockups/design examples of a home page and a deeper page (e.g tutorial page or something else within the site) and we can use these as a discussion point.  Ashish put together a list of other good sites (with brief comments) so that they can get a feel for what we're after.

If you have any questions, let me know.


Best wishes,
Amir

People have previously expressed interest in donating to OCaml projects but
there has been no way to do so. Perhaps OCaml Labs should put up one of its
projects on Kickstarter. If nothing else, it might be fun!

Slightly off topic but I thought the following was interesting. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homebrew/brew-test-bot

It's a kickstarter for the homebrew project [1] to set themselves up with some automated test/build equipment (i.e some Mac Minis with VMs).  It'll provide automated feedback to people who submit pull-requests, making the developers job a little easier.  Planning to launch it in April.  

The kickstarter opened today today and by the time you see this, will probably have (far) exceeded their goal.  Since I haven't seen any homebrew 'donate' buttons anywhere before this may release some pent up appreciation.  Crowd funding the machine pool is also an interesting idea.

Definitely, but not the test system. One of the systems projects is where all the real broad appeal lies, but let's get the basics done first!

The OCaml.org VMs have been somewhat bottlenecked on me recently, as I've been investigating different cloud toolstacks to handle all the various services we need.

I was somewhat underwhelmed by OpenStack, but our friends at OnApp have generously donated a lifetime license to run the ocaml.org infrastructure using the OnApp private cloud platform.  This means that we should be able to provision accounts for multiple people, but still have centralised backup and a shiny web interface. Sylvain, this will particularly apply to you immediately, but I imagine more things will come up.

I'm pretty new to using OnApp, so there may be teething problems, but I just wanted to update everyone that there is progress happening here!  My thanks to Julian Chesterfield from OnApp for arranging all of this.

I am not at all aware of the OnApp private cloud platform. From a quick
read of their website, I think this is a kind of provisionning/managing
system where you say "I want a VM, using Debian 6.0 x64, with 3GB of RAM
and 500GB of disk" (and get it). I suppose you also have to define a kind
of virtual IP that can be redirected in order to handle the failover.

It is a little bit overkilling for what I want, but lets take advantage of
this and see how we can play with it ;-)

I start to have a quite nice background on this kind of system, thanks to
my current job... I think in order to really take advantage of this you
need more then one computer (i.e. a cloud) and I am not sure it integrates
well with RPi setup. Although for launching self-contained server, like
oasis-db, this can be a very nice tools (but require more work and
discpline for deployment).

Looking forward to play with that.

Cheers
Sylvain

If you can have iPads and/or laptops setup, I'd put one on
try.ocamlpro.comand one on
ocaml.org.

We should find a vendor to make us stickers, mugs, and T-shirts. We could
simply use the new OCaml logo currently being designed. Ideally, we'd have
these for sale at the next OCaml Users Meeting. Maybe OCaml Labs could
provide the upfront costs in the hopes of recovering expenses through sales?

Hi,

For t-shirts stickers, don't forget zazzle/cafepress (or similar.)  
These may not be cost-effective but for small batches (just a few shirts 
to give away, for example) it might work on short notice.

That logo Amir just sent would look great on a white t-shirt!

Cheers,

T

Definitely a good idea to start assembling ideas for this stuff
(particularly with the web redesign ongoing).  

I demonstrated a lot of TryOCaml at FOSDEM last year. It was easy
to get people started...

Hi,

This is probably not 100% accurate but since it is all about
propagating OCaml, I ask here. There will be a small internal event
about FOSS in the company I worked for and I wish to know if we can
collect some nice poster/sticker/whatever so that I can have them
during the event (I am given the chance to present stuff here).

A good reference for this kind of stuff:
http://www.debian.org/events/material

Does it sound a good idea ? Do you have any idea about what I can
promote / demo during such an event ?

Cheers
Sylvain

It's being designed by an agency in Cambridge and I'm posting updates to the ocaml.org wiki on github [1].
I'll post other design related items here as they become ready for feedback.

I'm afraid we don't have the budget to think about conference material out of the OCaml Labs funding (e.g t-shirts/stickers etc).  Since we have a draft logo, would putting that onto a poster with some text be sufficient?

iPad, you are kidding me ;-)

I can have a Nexus 7/10 device, but the best option will probably be a
Chromebook.

I buy the idea of try.ocamlpro.com and the website. Although, since
its me (sorry), I need to talk about forge.ocamlcore.org....

Mugs/T-Shirts not sure. Stickers/Posters YES. My company allows me to
expense for printing a poster...

The even is set to happen on 8/3/2013, if I can have a nice poster to
print before it would be super nice...

Where is the OCaml logo being designed ?

Out of curiosity, why not do the opposite as I suggested?

I notice that all the proponents of staying on Google Groups use GMail,
and all the opponents don't.  It seems reasonable to be subscribed to
Google Groups via the mirroring scheme that Google provides.

The search is quite straightforward.  Use Google!  "site:lists.ocaml.org
opass" reveals the recent password-handling discussion, for example.  This
seems like a problem we need to solve on all the lists, not just Core, so
I don't see why some should on Google Groups, and others on
lists.ocaml.org.

If people are desperate for this functionality, I could always register
lists.ocaml.org as a Google Apps service and host our lists via that.
However, I view Groups as something of a second-class service at Google,
and don't really trust it in the long term.  Consider the Data Liberation
Front group at Google conspicuously skipping this service from their
"export your data" campaign.

I think that registering ocaml.org or lists.ocaml.org as a Google
Apps, can be a very effective way to build a pretty well managed
architecture for websites, ML et al. Spend time on building server to
test OCaml software, not managing spam and emails (I already did it
for quite some time and I think it is not a very efficient way to
spend my time).

To be honest I don't see the point of merging the mailing list of
Core, if the source code don't move as well to the very same server. I
don't see why the argument that applies to ML would not apply to
Source Code... If it is not broken, don't fix it.

Concerning, the "long term" of Google Groups if anything should change
you'll get a 6 months notice and will have plenty of time to move data
to a new servers.

I second the idea of considering registering ocaml.org with Google Apps. No
amount of work we'll ever do will compete with the features they already
have. I'm not concerned about lock-in since Google is not going anywhere
anytime soon, and if it ever does there will be a million people figuring
out how to export your data.

A cursory search of the Google Apps site put an end to this idea.

http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182667

"There are two types of groups: groups hosted in your domain and 
groups hosted by Google. Groups hosted in your domain are limited to
the users in your domain."

We already have the infrastructure set up and available, so barring
any immediately helpful suggestions, we'll go for the mirroring
option...

I'm not concerned about lock-in since Google is not going anywhere anytime soon, and if it ever does there will be a million people figuring out how to export your data.

I'm not sure what they mean here, but I just tested a group I run on NYU's
Google Apps domain. In the settings for that group I checked "Allow new
users not in nyu.edu", and I was able to subscribe my non-nyu.edu email to
the group. There's a further option that let's users add themselves or only
request membership that has to be approved by the list owner.

Regarding ownership, it seems a non-nyu.edu account cannot create a new
group, but once created, ownership can be assigned to a non-nyu.edu account.
