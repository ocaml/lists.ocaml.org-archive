</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Firstly, I agree that having license info at the top of each source file is better.  It becomes more clearly visible for people who are contributing solely via the web-based workflow (we've had a number of those now).

</I>
Isn't this overkill?  I was thinking one LICENSE file in the root and the brief mention in the source.
What do others think? (apologies if I've misunderstood this part of the thread)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Secondly, what's &quot;headache&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a tool in OCaml to change automatically the headers of many files.

Thanks.


&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, although this is not purely a licensing issue, I'm concerned about the comment &quot;whoever wants to customize its own version of the website ...&quot;.  If this a reference about people (already) wanting to fork the site and maintain other versions then I'm quite concerned.  Licensing shouldn't prevent content re-use but this sounds like the opposite of building a community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a link between preventing other people from creating their
</I>&gt;<i> variant of ocaml.org, and &quot;buiding a community&quot; (which I interpret as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;growing the OCaml community&quot;). I would prefer having 10 major
</I>&gt;<i> websites about OCaml (one for OCaml under Windows, one for the Chinese
</I>&gt;<i> community, one for OCaml on mobiles, etc.), with 10,000 users behind
</I>&gt;<i> each one, than having just one website with 500 users, which would be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the community website&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever you will do, however good you are, you will always end up
</I>&gt;<i> with forks. I raised the problem of governance earlier, because I
</I>&gt;<i> think it is a good way to delay such forks. Also, in a pull-request
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, I suggested to use Wikipedia policy on moderation: allow
</I>&gt;<i> all modifications a priori, and then remove/change wrong quality
</I>&gt;<i> modifications a posteriori when they are discovered. This way,
</I>&gt;<i> contributors will have their content online fast, and are less likely
</I>&gt;<i> to fork to get their contribution online by themselves.
</I>
In the interests of staying focused, I'll withhold my thoughts on most of the above for a separate thread.

On a practical note, I will say that we have *dramatically decreased* the time taken from merging something to seeing it live on the site.  This was a conscious effort and content is usually live just a couple of minutes after merging.  Where features are being added/changed, it's reasonable to expect some discussion, as you would with any software project (note that no-one changes features on wikipedia - only content).


&gt;<i> You might also want to have the equivalent of &quot;Affero GPL&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> contents (I am not a specialist, but I imagine some CC licenses do
</I>&gt;<i> that): let people use the content of this site, but force them to
</I>&gt;<i> allow you to take back their contributions.
</I>
The ShareAlike component of the CC-BY-SA deals with this.  As you've already mentioned OCamlPro is ok with the scheme as proposed so I don't think we need to consider any other licenses.

&gt;&gt;<i> Provided it can be done in an automated manner, I don't mind having one page on the site, even if some of the names looks odd.   I'd mention at the top that it's generated from the git log and I wouldn't worry too much about people with different names.  I'm more keen on keeping things automated, even if they're not perfect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To be more specific, I'd put the output of the following on a page (with additional text as above).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ git log --format=&quot;%aN&quot; | sort | uniq
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I count about 50 or so contributors (allowing for duplicates).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, it would be a very good thing.
</I>
There's now an issue to track this:
