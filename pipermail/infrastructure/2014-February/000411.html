<PRE>Very good move, thanks for doing this clarification !

However we do have a number of contents on ocaml.org ; we'll need to go through them and discuss their licensing internally to give a proper response.

Thanks,
Louis

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The content and implementation of the OCaml.org website do not have
</I>&gt;<i> licenses specified, which should be fixed. Our goal is to encourage
</I>&gt;<i> contributions, give appropriate credit to contributors, and maximize the
</I>&gt;<i> utility of the website for the entire OCaml community. We would like the
</I>&gt;<i> community's feedback on the following proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (A) Content is released under CC BY-SA 4.0 [1].
</I>&gt;<i> (B) Code that implements the site is released under the ISC license [2].
</I>&gt;<i> (C) Code examples within content are released under the UNLICENSE [3].
</I>&gt;<i> (D) Design of the site. All rights reserved by the OCaml.org project.
</I>&gt;<i> (E) OCaml logo is released under the UNLICENSE [3].
</I>&gt;<i> (F) Abstracts, slides from meetings. Rights retained by contributor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is our reasoning for each of the above:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (A) Content refers to text that is visible by readers at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ocaml.org(except">http://ocaml.org(except</A> for code; see (C) below). We'd like others to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to use these
</I>&gt;<i> materials but we don't want to create a situation where content that is
</I>&gt;<i> freely given to the community (which amounts to a substantive volume of
</I>&gt;<i> work) is then taken and monetized without giving back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The CC BY-SA 4.0 license [1] allows anyone to share and adapt the work,
</I>&gt;<i> including for commercial gain, as long as that work is also released under
</I>&gt;<i> the same (or compatible) license. This means that commercial works could be
</I>&gt;<i> produced but free versions would also have to be made available. Thus, the
</I>&gt;<i> community wouldn't lose out on any derivative work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (B) Code that implements ocaml.org. We want the code implementing the site
</I>&gt;<i> to be open source and available for others to use as they wish. Examples of
</I>&gt;<i> this include the files found under the 'script' folder of the repository
</I>&gt;<i> [6]. The ISC licence [2] has already been chosen for OMD and MPP, two
</I>&gt;<i> libraries that OCaml.org relies on substantially. Additional scripts are
</I>&gt;<i> not particularly complex in nature, and we feel their use should not be
</I>&gt;<i> restricted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (C) Code examples within content. For example, you can see many of these on
</I>&gt;<i> the 99 problems page [5]. These are typically small pieces of useful code
</I>&gt;<i> and we want people to be able to use them however they see fit. We want to
</I>&gt;<i> do this without the burden of attribution that an open source license (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> ISC) would require, so placing them in the public domain seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> sensible thing to do. The UNLICENSE [3] is one way of putting works in the
</I>&gt;<i> public domain and is how code examples in Real World OCaml are released [4].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (D) Design of the site. This is essentially the CSS, banner image, and
</I>&gt;<i> custom logos (except the OCaml logo, see (E) below). The design uniquely
</I>&gt;<i> identifies ocaml.org, and it would be awkward if another site looked
</I>&gt;<i> similar. It seems sensible to reserve all rights over the design and
</I>&gt;<i> disallow copying it in any form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (E) The new OCaml logo [7], which you see in the top-left of ocaml.org,
</I>&gt;<i> should be encouraged. We hope this can be a unifying symbol of all things
</I>&gt;<i> related to OCaml. Everyone should use this logo in their OCaml blogs,
</I>&gt;<i> websites, documentation, presentations, T-shirts, stickers, etc. Thus, it
</I>&gt;<i> should be usable freely by all, which can be achieved by releasing it under
</I>&gt;<i> the UNLICENSE.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (F) OCaml.org also hosts abstracts and slides for various meetings, such as
</I>&gt;<i> the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop. Contributors should retain all
</I>&gt;<i> rights over those works or be subject to whatever agreement they have with
</I>&gt;<i> the respective meeting. They are not considered part of the Content as
</I>&gt;<i> defined in (A).
