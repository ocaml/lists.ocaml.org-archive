Subject: [ocaml-infra] Rackspace cloud reboot
Message-ID: <8D3F16AA-C007-4A88-A18E-8616D5E64407@cam.ac.uk>

Apparently a large number of Rackspace servers are getting rebooted. I'm not sure if this affects the ocaml.org website or the packages at opam.ocaml.org. 

Anil, did you receive any notices? Is there anything we need to do to be ready for this?

Best wishes,
Amir

Thanks for pointing this out.  It's due to a currently embargoed security issue in Xen that required a widespread early rollout of patches.  We shouldn't be affected since all of the VMs are intended to reboot cleanly with their services running.  Please let me know if there are any oddities due to the event.
