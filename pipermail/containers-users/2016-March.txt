Subject: [containers-users] CCKMP should be... yeah, deprecated

Once more!

Currently I don't use `containers.string` much, although I do use
CCString basic features. I think having the functorial interface of
CCKMP [1] is nice, but it would be better in its own small opam library.
On the other hand, I plan to have a simple version of the algorithm
moved into CCString so it can make string search more efficient
(including all the split functions that rely on string search).

Cheers!
