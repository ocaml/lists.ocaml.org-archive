Subject: [containers-users] [ANN] release of containers-1.0
Message-ID: <20170211230232.GD3245@carty>

Dear all,

It is my great pleasure to announce the release of Containers 1.0, after
almost four years of development. Containers is a modular, clean and
powerful extension of the OCaml standard library, under the permissive
BSD license.

It is designed to be efficient, light on link-time dependencies, and to
complement the existing modules rather than replacing them.
The core library has no dependency on unix and should be usable
everywhere. Every module is independent and is prefixed with 'CC' in
the global namespace.  Alternatively, `open Containers` will bring
enhanced versions of the standard modules into scope, along with a few
modules that should exist, such as Option, IO or Int.
Containers now requires OCaml >= 4.01.

Containers also features sub-libraries for helping with threads,
S-expressions, and some unix utilities to invoke sub-processes.

I jump on the opportunity to thank the various users and contributors
that helped improving the code, kept asking for better solutions, and
reported bugs.

Cheers!

Congratulations on 1.0 release. This is one of my 'goto' ocaml libraries.

Heh, I'm fixing some of the breakages in my own projects right now.
Mostly, related to the now-defunct ugly "or_" named argument, some
renamed List functions, and the new printers. But it's still nice that
containers has gone such a long way :-)

yes, for me it was also mainly List.split and the ....print functions
which i replaced by ...pp
