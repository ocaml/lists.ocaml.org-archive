Subject: [containers-users] changing the defaults in CCFormat
Message-ID: <20161021140617.GK472@nunchakus.loria.fr>

Hello everyone,

I'm thinking of changing some of the printers in CCFormat (and other
modules), e.g. the `list` printer, so that it doesn't add a leading and
trailing `[` and `]`. Boxing and surrounding text can be added through
separate combinators (or format strings) anyway. @Drup suggested that I
follow more closely the `fmt` library by Daniel B?nzli, which is a good
idea, but it will come with some small breakages in how stuff is printed
if you didn't specify the optional arguments (they will remain, but
empty).

Cheers!
