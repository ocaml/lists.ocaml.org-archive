<PRE>Simon occasionally includes code from some other part of the libraries 
to avoid requiring, say, Gen to access Sequence or Containers; I don't 
remember offhand.&#160; In the case of some tiny piece of code thats 
sensible. (And so far that is all I have provided)

Pervasives has now a type uchar which Uutf uses consistently. In the 
case that one is not dealing with the many exigencies that Uutf deals 
with, thats a bit overkill?&#160; Alain Frisch used ints in Ulex and I 
remember another usage of uchar only in Camomille.

Uutf has a smaller range of codes that it accepts; namely Utf8.
Thats 0 to (1024 * 16) + (1024 * 16) + (64 * 1024) where 64k portion at 
the end is also excluded from the 1Mb range before.

Originally Utf8 encoded all possible codes in the positive int32 range.
I prefer to revert to the old standard; (and call it Utf31) since I this 
allows me to encode alphabets that are larger than, but include, the 
utf8 range.&#160; (This may not work with js_of_ocaml; but not all 
applications involve the web)
When it comes to comparing utf8 chars (codes; ints) consider the following:

utop # ((=));;
- : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt; after loading utop
utop # open Containers;;
utop # ((=));;
- : int -&gt; int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; type is overloaded
utop #

( I noticed this also in Jane Streets's &quot;Sequence&quot; .&#160; Possibly they want 
to avoid 'polymorphic'&#160; comparisons; i.e.: comparisons that examine the 
internal structure)

Did you intend to do that?
