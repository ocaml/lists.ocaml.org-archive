Subject: [containers-users] API design choice for including the stdlib
	modules
Message-ID: <20170410151659.GD4638@nunchakus.loria.fr>

Hello all,

@orbitz and @drup propose that containers' modules that extend the stdlib should
include the standard module, so that it's not necessary to remember
where a function lives.

For instance, `CCList` should include `List`, so that it's always
possible to replace `List` with `CCList`. No need to remember where
`combine`, `flatten` or `flat_map` live.

I am considering this change because it is not going to impact
modularity or code size much (we already depend on the stdlib anyway).

Also see:
https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/issues/109

Opinions and arguments welcome!

I concur with @orbitz and @drup. My arguments are exactly those written
above.

Subject: [containers-users] breakage in CCBV
Message-ID: <20170418200315.GP14022@carty>

Hello everyone,

The following issue should be of interest to anyone
using the bitvector module CCBV (i.e. at least me):
https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/issues/113

Given that the length-aware API would be nicer to have, but that right
now it assumes too much on the implementation, I think I have no choice
but to break some parts of the module's interface if this issue is to be
solved. That would affect mostly the parts about getting length/resizing
(which would be in terms of bitvector length, not length of the internal
buffer).

Does anyone object to this, or use the module in a way that might be
broken?

Cheers!
