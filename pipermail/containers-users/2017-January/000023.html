<PRE>Le Sat, 31 Dec 2016, Rudi Grinberg a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I wonder if this is too late to bring this up, but it would be really nice if
</I>&gt;<i> containers would replace its use of depopts with proper container sub packages.
</I>&gt;<i> Concretely, this would mean changing every depopt x to a container-x package
</I>&gt;<i> that depends on containers. It *does not* mean making any new git repositories.
</I>
It's not too late. It's an interesting idea, now the devil is in
the details.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is quite late in the cycle to ask for this, and the task is
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately non trivial given the build tools we have today. It's possible to
</I>&gt;<i> sorta of implement this using a little hack I've learned in conduit:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/blob/master/mirage-conduit.opam">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/blob/master/mirage-conduit.opam</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While this isn't ideal, it will future proof containers against any breakage
</I>&gt;<i> that might be caused by a proper split into opam sub packages.
</I>
If I follow correctly, you create a dummy package foo-bar whose dependencies
correspond to foo + those of the sub-package foo.bar, so that people
can depend on foo-bar freely. It's cheap indeed. The only drawback I can
see is that versions of all those packages have to be kept synchronized
manually.

&gt;<i> The discussion of depopts vs. proper sub packages has been brought up many times
</I>&gt;<i> before, so I'd rather not regurgitate the talking points unless there are
</I>&gt;<i> objections. Let me just say that I think the current this prevalence of using
</I>&gt;<i> depopts instead of proper sub libraries/packages is user hostile. And several
</I>&gt;<i> popular packages are already starting to move away from this (lwt for example).
</I>
I'm not sure I have read that much arguments about this design choice,
can you just point to them (e.g. for lwt)?

In any case, thanks for the opinion, it might very well happen :-)

and happy new year!
