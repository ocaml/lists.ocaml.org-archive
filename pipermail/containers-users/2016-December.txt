Hello there,

Release 1.0 is getting closer, as most points in issue #84 have been
addressed (at least for me). I should make a release candidate in the next
few weeks.

Note that 1.0 is much more breaking than usual:

- Some sub-libraries have disappeared (thread, advanced, bigarray, string)
- no more CCError, only CCResult
- no more CCPrint, only CCFormat
- label `or_` became `default`
- big changes in `CCGraph`
- big changes in `CCSexp` (now in only one module, powered by ocamllex, KISS)
- big changes to `CCOrd` (remove trailing `_`)
- big changes to `CCBitField` (less functor, more functions)
- removal of all deprecated functions
- simpler `CCHash`
- death of some modules in containers.data

non-breaking should include:
- labels versions of Array/List
- improvements to many existing modules (see the issue for more details)

branch: https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/tree/prepare-1.0
issue (with list): https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/issues/84

Cheers!

I wonder if this is too late to bring this up, but it would be really nice if
containers would replace its use of depopts with proper container sub packages.
Concretely, this would mean changing every depopt x to a container-x package
that depends on containers. It *does not* mean making any new git repositories.

Since this is quite late in the cycle to ask for this, and the task is
unfortunately non trivial given the build tools we have today. It's possible to
sorta of implement this using a little hack I've learned in conduit:

https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/blob/master/mirage-conduit.opam

While this isn't ideal, it will future proof containers against any breakage
that might be caused by a proper split into opam sub packages.

The discussion of depopts vs. proper sub packages has been brought up many times
before, so I'd rather not regurgitate the talking points unless there are
objections. Let me just say that I think the current this prevalence of using
depopts instead of proper sub libraries/packages is user hostile. And several
popular packages are already starting to move away from this (lwt for example).

Cheers,

Rudi.
