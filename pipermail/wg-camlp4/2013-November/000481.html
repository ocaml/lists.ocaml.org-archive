</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Merlin's version of the AST.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Does this work for sub-modules as well?  It's not rare in my
experience to do quite a bit of programming within a sub-module.  In a
top-level, you'd have to do that as one top-level chunk, which seems
like the wrong solution for merlin.

&gt;<i> Under the assumption that, for a given transformer t and without imposing an
</I>&gt;<i> order of transformation:
</I>&gt;<i> t (def1;; def2) ~= t(def1) ;; t(def2)
</I>&gt;<i> using this transformer in merlin should not require specific work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I don't know much about ppx. Here are the cases I see that
</I>&gt;<i> could be problematic in general:
</I>&gt;<i> - the transformer relies on some global state, that has to be threaded
</I>&gt;<i> across different invocations.
</I>&gt;<i> - the toplevel works only in a sequential way, and backtrack only if the
</I>&gt;<i> current definition fails to type. merlin can rollback to arbitrary point in
</I>&gt;<i> files, which could break assumptions in the transformer if there is a state.
</I>&gt;<i> - merlin also split definitions inside modules, which means that pieces of
</I>&gt;<i> ast could be extracted and transformed either separately or not in the
</I>&gt;<i> expected order (e.g. the signature constraining a structure can be extracted
</I>&gt;<i> by merlin and transformed as if it was an independent declaration, then
</I>&gt;<i> reinjected in the AST).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't quite know what the right solution is, but when 4.02 comes out
