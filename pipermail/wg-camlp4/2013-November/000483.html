</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The work done by the transformer when invoked by merlin or by the toplevel

</I>&gt;<i> top-level, you'd have to do that as one top-level chunk, which seems
</I>&gt;<i> like the wrong solution for merlin.
</I>
In merlin, yes.
This work for modules of the form &quot;module A (P0 : S0) &#8230; (Pn : Sn) : S = 
struct &#8230; end&quot;.
In this case, merlin adds (P0 : S0), &#8230; (Pn : Sn) to the environment, 
then work with definitions inside &quot;struct &#8230; end&quot; as it would do in the 
top-level context.

All cases are not handled (like completing inside the argument of a 
functor application, constraining the signature after the structure, not 
during the binding).

&gt;&gt;<i> Under the assumption that, for a given transformer t and without imposing an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order of transformation:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> t (def1;; def2) ~= t(def1) ;; t(def2)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using this transformer in merlin should not require specific work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That being said, I don't know much about ppx. Here are the cases I see that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be problematic in general:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the transformer relies on some global state, that has to be threaded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across different invocations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the toplevel works only in a sequential way, and backtrack only if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current definition fails to type. merlin can rollback to arbitrary point in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files, which could break assumptions in the transformer if there is a state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - merlin also split definitions inside modules, which means that pieces of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ast could be extracted and transformed either separately or not in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expected order (e.g. the signature constraining a structure can be extracted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by merlin and transformed as if it was an independent declaration, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reinjected in the AST).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't quite know what the right solution is, but when 4.02 comes out
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we're all going to be writing a bunch of new AST transformers, and if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we really want Merlin to be a success, we should have a plan for how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those transformers will integrate with it.
