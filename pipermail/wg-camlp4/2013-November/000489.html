Currently, the marshaled data has always the same type (and we are 
supposed to change its magic number if the format changes), so all the 
I/O logic for PPX transformers is wrapped in a type-safe API.

Here, we are talking about allowing a specific PPX transformer to return 
an extra piece of arbitrary data (unless we want to specify the type of 
the state).  The data only makes sense for a specific (version of a) PPX 
transformer, and it cannot be protected by a magic number.

</I>
Did you do some benchmarks?  I really don't know, but it could be the 
case that parsing + preprocessing the whole unit is fast enough.  For 
type-checking, I'm less sure, but a mechanism to reuse the result from 
the previous run on the common prefix should not be too difficult to 
support.  With such an approach, you could deal with a wider range of 
PPX rewriters without any custom support.


&gt;<i> I think that we should focus on providing a simple API for the most

</I>&gt;<i> backtracking stack, etc.). As long as the plugin informs its host of the

</I>&gt;<i> degradation.
</I>
The &quot;state monad&quot; API would work in the toplevel, but I believe you 
would need something more fine-grained for Merlin, in order to inform 
the rewriter about entering/leaving structures decomposed by Merlin 
itself.  Consider a rewriter which maintains a current &quot;path&quot; 
(collecting the M in &quot;module M = struct ... end&quot; for the current scope).
