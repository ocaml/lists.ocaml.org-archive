There should be no difference for the transformers at this stage.

</I>Indeed, ppx seems to be the opportunity to stop hardcoding extensions in 
merlin.

&gt;<i> A better idea, perhaps, would be to have some libraries or standards

</I>&gt;<i> naturally gain some level of incrementality.  Another, perhaps more
</I>&gt;<i> intrustive approach would be to write PPX transformers against
</I>&gt;<i> Merlin's version of the AST.
</I>The work done by the transformer when invoked by merlin or by the 
toplevel should be the same: the AST is given chunk-by-chunk, each chunk 
being passed for transformation.

Under the assumption that, for a given transformer t and without 
imposing an order of transformation:
t (def1;; def2) ~= t(def1) ;; t(def2)
using this transformer in merlin should not require specific work.

That being said, I don't know much about ppx. Here are the cases I see 
that could be problematic in general:
&#8722; the transformer relies on some global state, that has to be threaded 
across different invocations.
&#8722; the toplevel works only in a sequential way, and backtrack only if the 
current definition fails to type. merlin can rollback to arbitrary point 
in files, which could break assumptions in the transformer if there is a 
state.
&#8722; merlin also split definitions inside modules, which means that pieces 
of ast could be extracted and transformed either separately or not in 
the expected order (e.g. the signature constraining a structure can be 
extracted by merlin and transformed as if it was an independent 
declaration, then reinjected in the AST).
