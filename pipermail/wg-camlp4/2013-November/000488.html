Correct me if I am wrong, but the current code already relies on 
marshalling and this is where the unsafety lies &#8722; the external state can 
just be seen as an abstract type ?

Right. The point is that some extensions (like eliom) don't fit in the 
framework that merlin or the toplevel could expect for working 
incrementally.

I think that we should focus on providing a simple API for the most 
common cases (stateless transformers, then state monad, then 
backtracking stack, etc.). As long as the plugin informs its host of the 
way it is intended to be used, it is possible to provide graceful 
degradation.

Non compositional transformers are likely to be the exception rather 
than the rule (optimizations aside).
Also, I may stress that in the specific case of merlin, we are not 
interested by the implementation produced by a transformer, only by the 
interface, and this is how extensions are reimplemented right now. So as 
a last resort, plugins could be provide specific support for use inside 
an editor.
