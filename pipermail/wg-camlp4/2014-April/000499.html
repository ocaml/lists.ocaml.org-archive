<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> - I see the point of namespacing to avoid conflicts but I suspect conciseness is
</I>&gt;<i> also important here, if we want to use warning-tweaking directives in a fine-grained
</I>&gt;<i> enough way
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I suspect that the idea of warning over unknown ocaml.foo attributes is papering
</I>&gt;<i> over the real difficulty, which is the fact that it's very easy to make a mistake if
</I>&gt;<i> warnings are ignored by default. While giving more structure to an &quot;ocaml&quot; namespace
</I>&gt;<i> solves the particular problem Damien had with deprecated, chances are users will
</I>&gt;<i> still have their problems with the warnings they define on their own (or what about
</I>&gt;<i> [@@OCaml.warning]). We may want to think harder about resilience to user mistakes to
</I>&gt;<i> aim for a less ad-hoc solution.
</I>
Gabriel has a point here.&#160;&#160;As I see it, there are three broad approaches to namespacing:

&#160; 1) Namespace nothing.&#160; Use social norms to avoid name clashes between different projects.

&#160; 2) Namespace everything, including compiler extensions.&#160;&#160;Compiler can even enforce this
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; usage by requiring extension points to be of the form &quot;ns.name&quot;.

&#160; 3) No namespacing for generic and builtin attributes, such as &quot;default&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; or &quot;author&quot;, but socially-enforced namespacing for extension-specific attributes.

Here's my problem with solution 2: how do we deal with generic attributes that could be
used by more than one extension?&#160;&#160;(For instance, attribute &quot;default&quot; used by Sexplib
or Bin-prot, or documentation attributes such as &quot;author&quot; used by tools such as Ocamldoc).
This is why I'm leaning more towards solution 3.&#160;&#160;This approach would require a centrally
maintained list of non-namespaced attributes (a disadvantage, I admit), but this list
would be small and fairly static (we could require broad community approval before
adding another attribute).&#160;&#160;All other attributes would be namespaced, though I imagine
that the namespacing could itself be a social convention (eg. &quot;proj.attr&quot;) instead
of being enforced by the compiler.

As for the other problem Gabriel raised -- typos going unnoticed -- I reckon tooling
outside the compiler could be of help.&#160;&#160;A tool that went through the code base and
checked each usage of an extension point against a project whitelist would catch typos,
for instance.

Best regards,
Dario Teixeira
