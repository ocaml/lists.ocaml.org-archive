I don't particularly want to encourage that.  The standard use for 
[ocaml.warning] I have in mind is to control warnings for an entire 
compilation unit (thus simplifying the build system and making the unit 
more self-contained), maybe for a &quot;section&quot; of it (hence the warning on 
expressions, to allow begin[@ocaml.warning &quot;...&quot;] .... end), especially 
during development.  It would be a mess if people start to decorate 
their code with long-lasting warning-tweaking directives all over the 
place, in my opinion.  (Especially from a readability point of view: 
numbered warnings are quite unfriendly.)

&gt;<i> - I suspect that the idea of warning over unknown ocaml.foo attributes
</I>&gt;<i> is papering over the real difficulty, which is the fact that it's very
</I>&gt;<i> easy to make a mistake if warnings are ignored by default. While giving

</I>&gt;<i> [@@OCaml.warning]). We may want to think harder about resilience to user
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes to aim for a less ad-hoc solution.
</I>
A tool which checks for correct use of warnings could be useful, and not 
too difficult if one restrict to a &quot;white-list&quot; of known attributes 
(maybe some information about where they can be used, and potentially 
with some &quot;typing&quot; information).  Each tool operating on attributes (ppx 
or others) could come with a description of what it understands, to be 
processed by this checking tool.

That said, I wouldn't be surprised if code made available publicly 
contains attributes to be interpreted by tools which are not necessarily 
available where that code is compiled.  For instance, a company could 
publish code containing some internal &quot;code review markers&quot; (implemented 
as attributes).
