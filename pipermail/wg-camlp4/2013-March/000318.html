Quite not, as this is rewriter-dependent. A developer may very well
decide to accept both integers and floats for a given value for example.


(...)


&gt;<i> The only thing which is not checked is the fact that the attribute
</I>&gt;<i> itself is recognized (i.e. if you mistype the attribute name, the
</I>&gt;<i> attribute will just be ignored by the type-checker).
</I>
Yes, this is a potential pitfall.
And I would state things differently: the only thing that is checked
is that attribute values are syntactically well-formed.


&gt;<i>  We could introduce yet another syntax for non-ignorable attributes.
</I>&gt;<i>  Or we could create an &quot;attribute checker&quot; (a -ppx rewriter applied
</I>&gt;<i> after all the other ones, and which checks that no attribute remain
</I>&gt;<i> in the AST).  But since it
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> not an abnormal situation to have attributes remaining in the final
</I>&gt;<i> AST
</I>&gt;<i> (for later use by tools based on .cmt/.cmti files, for instance, such
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> a new ocamldoc), the tool would need to be configured with a list of
</I>&gt;<i> such attributes to accept.
</I>
Rather than a new syntax (they are already multiple), I would argue
for another solution:
  - maybe a tag to indicate that a given attribute has been preprocessed;
  - or, as the rewriter to register the attributes they handle and issue
    a warning if there is an attribute that cannot be treated by the
    rewriters.
Just wild ideas, though.
