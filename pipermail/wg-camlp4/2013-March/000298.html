I don't know if this is what you mean, but I claim that a general 
extension as a structure item is not needed.

The point is that:

include (:foo bar)

already exists; it is not a special case, just an instance of the 
constructions:

include MODULE_EXPR
or:
include MODULE_TYPE

and since we have extensions at the level of module expressions and 
types, the following is a valid structure/signature item:

include (:foo bar)

Given that, I don't see case where people would like to use extension as 
a signature/structure item but would not be happy with that form.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure whether this is a good idea or not,
</I>&gt;<i> and if it is I would rather aim for the more canonical &quot;struct (: foo
</I>&gt;<i> bar ) end&quot;, but I think tagging with terminals to get more structure
</I>&gt;<i> could be an interesting choice in other situations as well, eg. we
</I>&gt;<i> could possibly ditch prefix annotations and just use &quot;let (: foo bar )
</I>&gt;<i> in ...&quot;.
</I>
The difference is that attributes are ignored by the type-checker while 
extensions are rejected.
