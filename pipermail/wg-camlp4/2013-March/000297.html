I think Alain's point is not that &quot;include (: foo bar)&quot; would be
conflicting, but precisely that people could decide by convention that
when they want to write (: foo bar) as a structure item, they tag it
with an &quot;include&quot;. I'm not sure whether this is a good idea or not,
and if it is I would rather aim for the more canonical &quot;struct (: foo
bar ) end&quot;, but I think tagging with terminals to get more structure
could be an interesting choice in other situations as well, eg. we
could possibly ditch prefix annotations and just use &quot;let (: foo bar )
in ...&quot;.
