Oh yes, sorry, of course.

&gt;<i> I do think that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    let % lwt x = ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is potentially confusing. Maybe it would be better as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    let . lwt x = ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> since people nearly always write dots without spaces, and a dot
</I>&gt;<i> obviously can't be an operator.
</I>
If people see examples written &quot;let%lwt&quot;, they will probably do the 
same, don't you think?   &quot;%&quot; does not seem very common in OCaml code; I 
don't think people already have &quot;bad habits&quot; about it.  And if people 
insist to write &quot;let % lwt&quot;, it will be because they believe it somehow 
better.

I'm not very fond of &quot;let.lwt&quot;.  The dot symbol has already so many 
different uses in OCaml...  At least &quot;%&quot; is quite rare and will thus be 
clearly noticed as an extension.

&gt;<i> Another posibility would be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    let .% lwt x = ...
</I>
Do you believe it is worth making the syntax more heavy only to 
discourage (and not even prevent) people from potentially writing code 
with a style we don't like?

&gt;<i> It does seems like we're going from having a single extension syntax to
</I>&gt;<i> having many extension syntaxes. I can see the benefit of &quot;let % lwt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> since that will probably be a common extension point (the same goes for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;match % bit&quot;) but is there much to be gained from the other possible
</I>&gt;<i> keyword extensions.
</I>
function%ext and try%ext are also probably useful.

And I can imagine examples where {%ext x1=e1; ...; xn=en} would be 
useful as well (see the &quot;pre-polyrecord&quot; example).

At this point, why not be uniform, and do the same for all kinds of 
expressions starting with a well-defined keyword or symbol, including 
the parenthesized expressions &quot;begin%ext expr end&quot; and &quot;(%ext expr)&quot;. 
For other syntactic categories than expressions, this last form would be 
recognized (as the only syntax for extensions), instead of &quot;[%ext 
expr]&quot;.  There is a single syntax.

&gt;<i> While &quot;let % lwt&quot; may be alright, I do think that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( % id expr )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is a bad idea. It looks too much like a prefix operator. Also, having a
</I>&gt;<i> two character delimiter that isn't a single token is different from
</I>&gt;<i> every other two character delimiter in the langauge. It also means that
</I>&gt;<i> you can't use precedence to resolve conflicts in the parser. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> any real benefit in using (%id expr) instead of [%id expr]?
</I>
The benefit I can see is the uniformity with other forms of expressions:

    KW%id ...

where KW is the opening keyword/symbol (here &quot;(&quot;) and ... the rest of 
the construction starting with KW.
