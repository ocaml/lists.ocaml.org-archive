Yes, I've tried most of them.  Most of them work. A few number are 
rejected, but only because more work is needed on the parser (e.g. 
for[@id] is not yet supported, even though it would have taken less time 
to add support than to write this sentence; and class expressions do not 
yet support extension nodes).

It is true that there could be some discontinuity: at some point, you 
can shoehorn your &quot;DSL&quot; in the syntax of OCaml expressions, but when you 
extend it, you might not find a nice way to continue doing so and you 
might be forced to switch to a very different embedding.  I don't 
believe that this will be a serious problem in practice, in particular 
because one can always use an extension node with a string literal 
content  in order to use custom concrete syntax locally in most 
syntactic categories (or directly a string if the category accept it, 
i.e. expressions and patterns).  As an example, let's have a look at the 
bitstring example:

let bits = Bitstring.bitstring_of_file &quot;/bin/ls&quot; in
[%bit match bits with
|<i> [ 0x7f, 8; &quot;ELF&quot;, 24, string;  (* ELF magic number *)
</I>     e_ident, Mul(12,8), bitstring;    (* ELF identifier *)
     e_type, 16, littleendian;    (* object file type *)
     e_machine, 16, littleendian  (* architecture *)
   ] -&gt;
   printf &quot;This is an ELF binary, type %d, arch %d\n&quot;
     e_type e_machine
]

One can imagine that in an early version, the size field could only be 
specified as an int literal.  When the author decides to let his users 
write &quot;12*8&quot;, he can decide between:

  - Creating some &quot;DSL&quot; to describe those formulas, with a syntax 
compatible with patterns, as I did in the example above (Mul(12, 8))

   e_ident, Mul(12,8), bitstring;    (* ELF identifier *)

  - Using a string to represent the formula (but then one must create a 
new parser... or call the OCaml parser!):

   e_ident, &quot;12 * 8&quot;, bitstring;

  - Using an extension node to allow injecting an expression without 
requiring a parser:

   e_ident, [%sz 12 * 8], bitstring;

   (Here we don't care about the &quot;id&quot; of the extension node.  It is 
worth creating a syntax for name-less extension nodes?)



&gt;<i> - For multi-line quotations, I would appreciate a slightly more
</I>&gt;<i> explicit syntax (possibly the symmetric delimiter to help users see
</I>&gt;<i> where the quotation end).
</I>
Do you mean:

[%bit ... %bit]
or:
[%bit ... bit%]
or:
[%bit ... %]

or something else?

Note than one can also write:

begin[@bit]
....
end

The only difference is that if we compile without the &quot;bitstring 
expander&quot;, we will probably get a type-error which might be a little 
harder to understand.  I was thinking about supporting:

begin[%bit]
....
end

as an equivalent to:

[%bit ....]

but this would be ambiguous (function appliction with [%bit] in function 
position).
