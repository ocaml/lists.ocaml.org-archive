No, I really meant (expr (@id arg)).

It is really the same as:

begin[@id arg] ... end

being equivalent to:

... [@id arg]

i.e. putting the attribute on the opening keyword (here the opening 
parenthesis being considered as the opening keyword).

&gt;<i> I have to agree with Gabriel here, these things are a pain to get
</I>&gt;<i> right. If you don't handle it in the lexer then you allow things like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     let% lwt x =  (* defining a lwt function? *)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    let % lwt x = (* defining the % operator? *)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is definitly undesirable. It also allows comments and newlines to
</I>&gt;<i> be inserted in awkward places.
</I>
I can see that there is a possibility to write awkward code, but I don't 
think people would actually do it.  We can try to find a better syntax, 
but I would find it sad to pick something more heavy only because the 
light syntax could theoretically allow people to write confusing code.

I don't see &quot;let % lwt&quot; as a worst kind of code than:

   let (* oh, you really believe I'm going to define a local value here ?
   Wait a minute ...*)

   open List

   (* and now you think this is a global open statement *)

   in
   ...


&gt;<i> This means that you must lex &quot;let%lwt&quot; as a single token which can be a
</I>&gt;<i> bit awkward. It is probably ok for a few specific cases, but expanding
</I>&gt;<i> it to all keywords is asking for trouble.
</I>
If we go this way (and as said I'm not convinced this is required) this 
would only be necessary for the keywords used as the first token of 
expressions (e.g. not &quot;in&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;to&quot; for instance).  And we could 
limit ourselves to the most useful ones only.


&gt;<i> I don't think this is a good idea because you are parsing '%' as a
</I>&gt;<i> strange prefix operator, so that all of the following are allowed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (% foo expr) ( %foo expr ) ( % foo expr )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ((* hello world*)%
</I>&gt;<i>    foo expr
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>
Again, we can try to fix that in the lexer/parser, or just publicize the 
&quot;good style&quot;.  I don't think that the grammar is supposed to prevent 
people from writing un-readable code, just to allow and encourage them 
to write good one.
