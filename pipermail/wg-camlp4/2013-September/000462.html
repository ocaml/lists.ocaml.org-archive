There is no semantics, no binding structure, the payload of attributes 
and extension points are just fragments of surface syntax.  The meaning 
is given by the tools which manipulate them.

&gt;&gt;<i> I expect arguments of attributes to be rather small fragments of syntax, so I don't see any real problem here.  Are you concerned by the size of .cmi file on disk, the time to read them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both, as they are connected. Also the fact that this might keep some unnecessary details.
</I>
I really think performance is a non-issue here.  For usual cases, each 
attribute will add a few bytes to the .cmi file.

&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, one could simplify the internal representation of &quot;payloads&quot; (attribute and extension node arguments) to a single case in the internal representation, and keep alternative syntaxes only as sugar, but what is the benefit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more uniform semantics ?
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I do not say that this should be the representation used, but saying that the two are equivalent clarifies the semantics.
</I>
They are not currently equivalent: a ppx filter could very well react 
properly on:

  [@invariant? A | B]

and fail on:

  [@invariant (function A | B -&gt; true | _ -&gt; false)]

If we decide to consider the first form as syntactic sugar second for 
the second form, then yes, they become equivalent!
