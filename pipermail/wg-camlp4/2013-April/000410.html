Sorry for the delay, I was not paying attention to the list at the time
(and the personal copy was sent to my list folder automatically as well&#8230;).

Not that I strongly object at all, but I would just point out that the
reverse is also true: one may not understand why some expression
sometimes has type 'a and sometimes has type, well, something else.

For instance, let's imagine a rewriter expands:

let check () =
  check_platform_is[@32]

into either:

let check () =
  assert false (* if on 64bits *)

or:

let check () =
  () (* if on 32bits *)

Now, imagine the programmer does not realize this, and puts the
following type in the .mli:

val check: 'a (* or anything except unit *)

If he does not actually call this function, the programmer will only see
the error when compiling for another platform, and he may be quite
puzzled as well.

Now, that's maybe not a strong enough argument against simplification
though. Just an interesting fact.

&gt;<i>  - It is not clear what to do with &quot;assert (false[@foo])&quot;.
</I>
That's very true.
