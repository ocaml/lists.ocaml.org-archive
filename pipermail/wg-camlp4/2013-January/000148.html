This could have a even better solution (not global Ast rewriting) in Fan
without introducing any global Ast rewriting.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And Ast Rewriter is not composable at  all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suppose you have two AST Rewriters A,B ,there are no guarantee that  A.B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> == B.A, it just gives you an illusion that it works, probably it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> silently fails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree.  A and B are functions from AST to AST, so there is a very
</I>&gt;<i> nice notion of composition: the composition of functions.  It is true that
</I>&gt;<i> A.B and B.A don't have the same behavior but at least, I can understand
</I>&gt;<i> what A.B and B.A will do as soon as I know how A and B behave individually,
</I>&gt;<i> without having to know anything about their implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For any nontrivial Ast Rewriter, I totally get lost, maybe I am dumb and
</I>you use objects here(ast_mapper) suppose both ast_mapper try to inject some
bindings at the beginning, what do you expect here? Besides, there's no
reason that Ast Rewriter should be pure, once is impure, how shall I reason
the program?

&gt;<i> I know you have projects to provide a cleaner functional API for grammars,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see how modifications of the concrete syntax can be combined,
</I>&gt;<i> in full generality, in a predictable way.  It seems you also have plans to
</I>&gt;<i> get rid of the ability to modify the concrete syntax.  This sounds very
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have provided purely functional grammars API which helps a lot to limit
</I>the scope of the syntax extension*, if people don't like it, just not
expose it, or write another frontend with fixed grammar.* But we do have a
lot of things that Ast Rewriter does not provide, quasiquotation(which I
think is a *fundamental* difference from ppx), quotation(delimited DSL),
ast rewriter(the same as ppx), type hook(the example I gave before), lexer
hook, and lots other stuff

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      3. How do you implement the expander?  Somehow, you need to parse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the content of the quotation (stored as a string in the AST), which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     involves non trivial stuff, like a parser being able to parse OCaml
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     code mixed with something else.  Personally, I don't know how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     implement the quotation expander with the parsing technologies I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     familiar with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you design your DSL, the left part is pretty easy to parse, when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you see the delimiter &quot;-&gt;&quot;, invoking an existing parser.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you need to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Write a custom parser for left parts (regexps), which stops at &quot;-&gt;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> To write this parser, you need to use ocamlyacc, menhir, or another tool.
</I>&gt;<i> (And probably plug the official OCaml lexer?)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Call the official(?) OCaml parser on its &quot;expr&quot; entry and hope that it
</I>&gt;<i> stops exactly when it encounters the next &quot;|&quot; (does this really work?).
</I>&gt;<i>  - Adapt the locations returned by this parser, or be careful to
</I>&gt;<i> initialize the lexbuf with locations that match exactly the concrete
</I>&gt;<i> location of the corresponding part in the original source code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is *already implemented in Fan within tens of lines of code,* you
</I>are much more experienced than me, so I bet you definitely could parse it!
(I don't consider tens of lines of code is complex.. ) my taste shows that
its notation is much more elegant than sedlex (imho)

&gt;<i> This seems much more complex than the current implementation of sedlex (or
</I>&gt;<i> a variant of it where regexps would be written with some concrete syntax),
</I>&gt;<i> for no obvious benefit.
