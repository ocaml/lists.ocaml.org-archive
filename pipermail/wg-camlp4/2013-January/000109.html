<PRE>&gt;<i>What makes sense is maybe to distinguish attributes which can be dropped 
</I>&gt;<i>silently by the compiler (but used by other tools like ocamldoc, for 
</I>&gt;<i>instance) and those on which the type-checker needs to fail.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i>not strictly necessary if we already have a new kind of expressions on 
</I>&gt;<i>which the type-checkers fail, and it does not really bring much security 
</I>&gt;<i>because the user could easily use the other syntax of attributes and get 
</I>&gt;<i>(probably) simply a type error instead of a &quot;remaining attribute&quot; error.
</I>
An extension could only support {: foo } style attributes (the ones that 
the type-checker fails on), so then there would be no risk of a typo or 
missed ppx option causing a silent fail or an unhelpful error message.

I also think that it will make it easy to read code: If you see {: ... } 
then that will be translated into an expression/patter/..., if you see {% 
... } then you know that the expression it is attached to will be 
translated.

For instance, &quot;foo bar {: ... }&quot; means that foo will be called with bar and 
whatever that attribute becomes as arguments. &quot;foo bar {% ... }&quot; means that 
foo and bar are going to be translated in some way.

And since we're probably supporting &lt;: ... &gt;, I see no harm in supporting 
&lt;% ... &gt; as well, especially if we support {: ... } and {% ... } (or (: ... 
) and (% ... ) if you prefer).

</PRE>
