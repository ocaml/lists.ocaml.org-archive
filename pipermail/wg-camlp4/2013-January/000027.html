Maybe the simplest solution to maintaining backwards compatibility is to ship pre-processed source code (using -ppx version) in release tarballs of libraries,
but that isn't without problems either:
+ you don't need to have 4.00.1 to build newer versions of libraries
+ you can switch to the -ppx syntax in your library
+ building the library doesn't require building/running the syntax extension
- you need a simple way to do this, i.e. oasis/OCamlMakefile/etc. should be updated to support this transparently
- ppx's output has to be converted to source code again, and that must be backwards compatible with older OCaml versions
- ppx transformations have to be architecture independent
- without an automated way to test the above it could easily break

&gt;<i>  Who is really stuck with old versions
</I>&gt;<i> of ocaml (and still wanting and able to use new versions of packages)?
</I>
My use-case would be: I write an application that I want to be buildable at least with OCaml 3.12.1 and 4.00.1 (3.11.2 support would be nice, but not required).
The end-user doesn't have to be aware of what OCaml is, I just want them to run my application on their OS without having to build a compiler to do that.

Of course I can stick to the last version of a library that supports both (if they introduce an incompatibility) but then I'd have to backport
bugfixes to a private branch on my own. If it comes to that I'd rather figure a way to distribute preprocessed OCaml source code for the libraries that I use.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also it'd be nice to have:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   -ppt Typedtree -&gt; Typedtree for type-level transformations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe this is a viable option.  Producing Typedtree without breaking invariants of the type system (and the type soundness) is extremely challenging.  I'd be more comfortable with supporting
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;Typedtree -&gt; Parsetree&quot; pass, where you'd only need to be able to use information from the typedtree so as to produce fragments of code which are then type-checked again.  You don't need to fully
</I>&gt;<i> understand everything in the Typedtree to do that, and the type-checker acts as a safety net.
</I>&gt;<i> OCamlPro worked on a project called &quot;OCaml Templates&quot; doing exactly that, but I don't know the status of this project.  (Someone from OCamlPro to comment?)
</I>
That'd work too, although the -ppx based tool could do all that on its own. There wouldn't be any compiler changes required (i.e. no -ppt), just a library
like astmapper to simplify this task.

In fact my -ppl proposal is not really needed either, it could be just a library and the tool: a -pp based tool.

The tool would be invoked by -pp:
load all plugins
read source
use OCaml's lexer from compiler-libs to create tokens
apply any token mappers from the plugins
create the parsedtree using compiler-libs again
apply any astmappers from the plugins
run any ppx astmappers given on cmdline
create the typedtree using compiler-libs
apply and typedtree -&gt; parsetree mappers from the plugins
output the ast

This would then be an almost drop-in replacement for camlp4, except that syntax extensions (plugins here) will depend on compiler-libs instead of camlp4,
and of course you would have similar limitations as -ppx, except you can modify the tokenstream as well.
I haven't checked how ocamlfind invokes camlp4 exactly, but it might be possible to reuse its camlp4 support for this.

Best regards,
--Edwin
