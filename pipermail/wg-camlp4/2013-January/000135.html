</I>
Well, I had some private discussions with Alain before this list  
started.

A central point is that the ppx driver and ocamlfind remain separate  
software projects. You need the ability to use ppx preprocessors  
without ocamlfind, and the role of ocamlfind is &quot;only&quot; to make it more  
user-friendly. This should be similar to normal library lookup - where  
ocamlfind finally generates only a command where many details are  
filled in.

Alain had the idea to include the names of the preprocessors directly  
in the source text. He chose the syntax

include PPX(First_ppx_processor)(Second_ppx_processor)

Well, we probably can now select something better, not reusing the  
&quot;include&quot; notation for something that is not &quot;include&quot;. Maybe let's  
prefer now

(:PPX &quot;first_ppx_preprocessor&quot; &quot;second_ppx_preprocessor&quot;)

just to pick the current discussion up. The task of the ppx driver is  
to interpret these directives, and to run the preprocessors in the  
right order as subcommands (or, if the platform supports it, as  
plugins).

Ocamlfind integration: The problem here is that such a directive needs  
to be forwarded to ocamlfind in order to figure the details out. This  
would need a relatively tight coupling between the ppx driver and  
ocamlfind. In order to avoid that the ppx driver calls ocamlfind for  
every activated preprocessor, the idea is to make the ppx driver a  
library, maybe with a single function

preprocess : (string -&gt; string) -&gt; in_channel -&gt; out_channel

The string-&gt;string function is the lookup function. It takes a string  
like &quot;first_ppx_preprocessor&quot; and returns the command to run.

So, that enables us to provide two utilities:

  - ocamlppx: This would be part of the OCaml distribution, and would be
    limited in functionality. In particular, it interprets the ppx  
strings
    directly as commands (identity as lookup function):

    (:PPX &quot;/path/to/my/ppx/executable maybe arguments&quot;)

  - ocamlfind ppx: This version provides extended lookup features.
    You would just use

    (:PPX &quot;package-name&quot;)

    and it is ocamlfind's task to look the executable up (or,  
optionally,
    load a plugin, but the details of the mechanism are hidden from the
    simple user).
