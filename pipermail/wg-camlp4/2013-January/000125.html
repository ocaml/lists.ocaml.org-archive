something like bisect. And Ast Rewriter is not composable at  all, suppose

just gives you an illusion that it works, probably it silently fails.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. How do you implement the expander?  Somehow, you need to parse the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> when you design your DSL, the left part is pretty easy to parse, when you

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> allowing to write XML code in XML syntax within OCaml sources.  But even
</I>&gt;<i> there, I'm not absolutely sure that quotations are the best solution: would

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (@xml)&quot;&lt;div&gt;xyz&lt;/div&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or OCaml syntax interpreted specially:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (@xml)(div &quot;xyz&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the current:

</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;:html5&lt; &lt;div&gt;xyz&lt;/div&gt; &gt;&gt;

I did not mention that in Fan, we already support {:|?  ?|} , like Perl you
can supply an extra matching char to handle more complex cases.

Anyway, I think it would great to get the Abstract Syntax right before the
details on concrete syntax.

&gt;<i> But maybe for some cases (embedding a language with a lot of double quoted
</I>&gt;<i> and backslashes), escaping from the lexical conventions of OCaml string
</I>&gt;<i> literals might really be useful.  This could be actually be the case for
</I>&gt;<i> standard string literals, with no special syntactic processing.  So why not
</I>&gt;<i> simply address this need by allowing an alternative syntax for string
</I>&gt;<i> literals, where no special character is interpreted?  The opening delimiter
</I>&gt;<i> would define the closing delimiter.  For instance:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   {xxx{ ..... }xxx}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (here I've assumed that { } are hard-coded, but xxx could be replaced say,
</I>&gt;<i> by any sequence of identifier/digit/operator characters). In the AST, this
</I>&gt;<i> could be represented as a normal string literal (or maybe we should keep
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;xxx&quot; annotation, to avoid having to put an extra attribute in front of
</I>&gt;<i> the literal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've yet to be convinced that quotations really have other interesting
</I>&gt;<i> uses than escaping from lexical conventions of OCaml string literals...
