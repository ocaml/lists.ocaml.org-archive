<PRE>I very much agree with Alain on this.  Having a simple core seems
essential, from a number of viewpoints.  Implementation complexity
alone seems to demand it.

Moreover, I would argue that we should move past the question of
whether to build a simpler thing, and focus more on what that simple
thing should look like.  Once we have a clearer idea about that, we
can circle back and make sure we think like the end result is good
enough to justify the change.

</I>&gt;<i> MetaOCaml, OCamlDuce, or LexiFi's local version).  As a very concrete
</I>&gt;<i> example, Jacques Garrigue recently proposed a patch (for generative
</I>&gt;<i> functors) which requires a (light) extension to the OCaml syntax.  Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, he did not upgrade Camlp4 (its version of the OCaml AST, its N
</I>&gt;<i> parsers, and the mapping to the regular OCaml AST) yet.  So you cannot try
</I>&gt;<i> this patch on your whole project if it depends on any camlp4-based tool.
</I>&gt;<i> This is very sad, isn't it?  Projects which rely on -ppx (like Bisect,
</I>&gt;<i> sedlex, omonad) work perfectly ok with Jacques'  patch and nobody had to
</I>&gt;<i> suffer to make this happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should we build something simple on top of something complicated when it
</I>&gt;<i> is rather easy to build the simple solution directly?  This seems much more
</I>&gt;<i> robust and future proof to me.  Those who enjoy the extra complexity (or
</I>&gt;<i> actually need it) can indeed continue to work on and use camlp4/camlp5/fan.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not incompatible with -ppx at all. But the day ocamlfind, lwt,
</I>&gt;<i> js_of_ocaml, type_conv and other &quot;infrastructure&quot; tools will work without
</I>&gt;<i> camlp4, I will feel much more comfortable relying on them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have reasons to believe that -ppx based tools will interact nicely
</I>&gt;<i> with each other, better than camlp4 ones (I think about the
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate incompatibility between deriving and type_conv). I claim that
</I>&gt;<i> camlp4's model of independent extensions being allowed to tweak the concrete
</I>&gt;<i> syntax as they want by mutating grammar rules is a design mistake with
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate consequences.  I have other technical concerns with camlp4 and I
</I>&gt;<i> will try to summarize them in a blog post, so as to keep this mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> more focused to pushing alternatives to camlp4 (rather than justifying why
</I>&gt;<i> this is a good idea to do so).
