Ok, there are two debates here : one is about the implementation, the 
other one is about the accessibility.

 From the implementation point-of-view, you have to know all the parsers 
at parsing time, because you need the function to recognize their 
antiquotations. In my implementation of ocaml-templates, there was a 
parser to load new parsers (&lt;:dynlink&lt;pa_to_string&gt;&gt;). These new parsers 
would be loaded while parsing the string inside the quotation, i.e. 
during typing, not during parsing. In your case, you would not be able 
to do that, unless you provide natively this mechanism to load parsers 
dring parsing.

 From the accessibility point-of-view, having a convention for 
quotations/anti-quotations is both simpler for users (they can 
understand more of what is happening even if they don't know the syntax 
extensions, because anti-quotations are always written in the same way), 
and for developers (they don't need to provide a function to recognize 
their own anti-quotations, and actually, they don't even need to think 
about which delimiters to use for their syntax).

During such debates, I always think about Ruby's &quot;convention over 
configuration&quot;, and why some languages are widely adopted while they are 
actually less powerful than OCaml (and Camlp4 is very powerful...).
