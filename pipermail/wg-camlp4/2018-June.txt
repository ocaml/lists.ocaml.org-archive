Hello! WannaCry returned! All your devices were hacked with our program installed on them. We have upgraded operation of our program, so you will not be able to recover your data after the attack. 
All the information will be encrypted and then erased. Antivirus software will not be able to detect our program, while firewalls will be emasculate against our one-of-a-kind code. 
Should your files be encrypted, you will lose them forever. 
Our program also covers the local network, erasing data on all computers connected to the network and remote servers, all cloud-stored data, and blocking website operation. We have already deployed our program on your devices. 
Deletion of your data is scheduled for June 22, 2018, at 5:00 - 10:00 PM. All data stored on your computers, servers, and mobile devices will be destroyed. Devices working on any version of Windows, iOS, macOS, Android, and Linux are subject to data erasion. 
In order to prevent data demolition, you can pay 0.1 BTC (~$650) to the bitcoin wallet:15TEifb6Dwvbvr2DQHs9PW2nXkYCWVZPFr 
You must pay timely and notify us about the payment via email until 5:00 PM on June 22, 2018. After payment confirmation, we will send you instructions on how to avoid data erasion and such situations from now forward. Should you try to delete our program yourself, data erasion will commence immediately.
To pay with bitcoins, please use localbitcoins.com or other similar platforms, or just google for other means. After payment write to us: support_wc at bitmessage.ch
