Why not, but I'm still not convinced that the &quot;unsafe&quot; interface will 
create actual interaction problems between extensions, which cannot be 
solved by a proper ordering between -ppx rewriters.

Can we try to come up with some realistic example of potential problems 
before considering solutions to address those problems?

&gt;<i> - Leo suggests using an in-language feature (namespaces) to handle

</I>
As long as ppx rewriters are specified purely on the command-line, 
ocamlfind do the lookup quite easily:

ocamlfind ocamlc -c -package sedlex -ppx &quot;ocamlfind sedlex/sedlex.exe&quot; 
my_file.ml

(this already works)

I don't see any Windows-specific problem here (but I've not tried to use 
ocamlfind under Windows for a long time).

A more ambitious proposal is to let rewriters be specified in the source 
code.  Gerd has described a way to combine this with ocamlfind without 
forcing a dependency on ocamlfind.  I'm still undecided on whether it is 
good or not to specify rewriters in the source code.
