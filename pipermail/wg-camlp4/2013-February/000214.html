<PRE>Hi, Jeremy,
   I like your ideas, ;-). Fan adopt the same approach as you proposed.
Instead of
    (@deriving [&quot;sexp&quot;; &quot;json&quot;])
   type t = F of int | G of s
    and s = H of (t * t)

I used the notation
{:ocaml|
type t = F of int | G of s
and s = H of (t * t)
|<i>}
</I>{:derive| (sexp,json)|}
But the semantics are essentially the same,
should we take a serious look at Fan? As a much more advanced tool, Fan,
compared with ppx, while it does not require any change to the compiler,
and porting other camlp4 based library is much easier, I see a lot of
benefits here.

If we change the compiler a lot for little benefit in the internal
compiler, that makes life too hard for more advanced tools, are we a bit
short-sighted here? I really like some other features like run-time types
in the compiler instead, my 2 cents

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, I think -ppx + arbitrary annotations, without any further

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important problem with Camlp4 is that it allowed syntax extension
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; writers to modify the syntax in very bad way that hurt robustness. As
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already discussed, I have a strong distaste for extensions that only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; piggyback on existing syntax (without adding any explicit marker); I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would feel safer if the extension *mechanism* disallowed such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unstructured extensions, or at least made them less rewarding to write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the composable ones. (For example by only passing to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extension writer the part(s) of the AST that have been annotated).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, I don't see how Bisect would fit any such restriction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that's a problem best solved by socialization (writing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation on good practices, and yelling on people), but I sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doubt it -- I don't know how many time I've had to argue for *not*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; globally changing the associativity of infix operators through Camlp4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in Batteries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Gabriel.  Actually, I think that a small tweak to the
</I>&gt;<i> design of -ppx could address both this and a number of problems that
</I>&gt;<i> others have raised during the discussion here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The -ppx approach applies one or more global transformations to the
</I>&gt;<i> ASTs of OCaml source files; these transformations can be parameterized
</I>&gt;<i> by attributes attached at particular points in the syntax tree.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is a significant improvement over the Camlp4 approach, largely because
</I>&gt;<i> it exchanges the (unnecessary) ability to change the concrete syntax
</I>&gt;<i> for a number of valuable guarantees, which make extensions easier to
</I>&gt;<i> write and code that uses extensions easier to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can go further in this direction, and give up more (unnecessary)
</I>&gt;<i> power in return for further guarantees.  As Gabriel says, since -ppx
</I>&gt;<i> extensions can arbitrarily transform the AST, it's not possible to
</I>&gt;<i> understand any part of a program that uses extensions without
</I>&gt;<i> understanding every aspect of the behaviour of every extension.  We
</I>&gt;<i> could, of course, seek to solve this by convention and social
</I>&gt;<i> pressure, but there seems to be an emerging consensus that this isn't
</I>&gt;<i> really satisfactory.  One of the nice things about functional
</I>&gt;<i> programming is that you have strong guarantees (via parametricity,
</I>&gt;<i> immutability, and so on) about the effects of calling a particular
</I>&gt;<i> function. We should strive to make it possible to reason in the same
</I>&gt;<i> manner about the effects of syntax extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are other legitimate concerns with the current proposal.  As
</I>&gt;<i> Xavier Clerc and others point out, attributes are apparently
</I>&gt;<i> undeclared (i.e. global) and untyped.  Alain rightly notes that it
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be difficult to introduce declarations and types for
</I>&gt;<i> attributes without significant complexity.  Still, as OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> programmers we're used to the benefits of precisely-scoped names and
</I>&gt;<i> strongly-typed data, and it seems a shame to give these benefits up if
</I>&gt;<i> we can find a way to keep them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hongbo Zhang raises a further concern: when syntax extensions are
</I>&gt;<i> global transformations on the whole file, the order in which
</I>&gt;<i> extensions are applied becomes significant.  This is a fairly serious
</I>&gt;<i> matter, I think: the semantics of code that uses syntax extensions is
</I>&gt;<i> now dependent on external factors, since we need to look for the flags
</I>&gt;<i> passed to OCaml in the build configuration in order to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can address all these concerns with a small adjustment in
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.  Instead of globally-scoped, untyped attributes processed
</I>&gt;<i> by file-level externally-specified transformations, we might add a
</I>&gt;<i> single node to the OCaml grammar for statically-executed AST
</I>&gt;<i> rewriters.  Using the same syntax already proposed for attributes, we
</I>&gt;<i> might write, for example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    (@deriving [&quot;sexp&quot;; &quot;json&quot;])
</I>&gt;<i>    type t = F of int | G of s
</I>&gt;<i>     and s = H of (t * t)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (@perform)
</I>&gt;<i>        (x &lt;-- m;
</I>&gt;<i>         y &lt;-- n;
</I>&gt;<i>         return (x y))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order for this to be valid code, 'deriving' and 'perform' should
</I>&gt;<i> resolve to functions of appropriate types:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     val deriving : string list -&gt; Parsetree.structure_item -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Parsetree.structure_item
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     val perform : Parsetree.expression -&gt; Parsetree.expression
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either during parsing or in a post parsing phase, the ASTs following
</I>&gt;<i> '@deriving [&quot;sexp&quot;; &quot;json&quot;]' and '@perform' are passed to those
</I>&gt;<i> functions and the results are inserted in place into the AST.
</I>&gt;<i> Gabriel's concern is addressed, because there's no way for @perform
</I>&gt;<i> (say) to access other parts of the AST: its effects are purely local.
</I>&gt;<i> Xavier's concern is addressed, since AST rewriters, unlike attributes
</I>&gt;<i> are declared and typed (and hence scoped). Hongbo's concern is
</I>&gt;<i> addressed, since composition is explicit:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (@deriving [&quot;sexp&quot;])
</I>&gt;<i>     (@nonrec)
</I>&gt;<i>     type t = C of t
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Here '@deriving [&quot;sexp&quot;]' is applied to the result of applying '@nonrec'.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be possible to write almost all extensions in this manner.
</I>&gt;<i> A variant of the stream parser syntax fits easily:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (@parser)
</I>&gt;<i>        ([ `If; x = expr; `Then; y = expr; `Else; z = expr ] =&gt; &quot;if&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>         [ `Let; `Ident x; `Equal; x = expr; In; y = expr ] =&gt; &quot;let&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> as does Anil's cstruct extension:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (@cstruct ~endianness:little)
</I>&gt;<i>     type pcap_header = {
</I>&gt;<i>        uint32_t magic_number;   (* magic number *)
</I>&gt;<i>        uint16_t version_major;  (* major version number *)
</I>&gt;<i>        ...
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other extensions such as ifdef, js_of_ocaml, and pgsql could be
</I>&gt;<i> handled in the same sort of way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [I'm deliberately avoiding the interesting but orthogonal questions of
</I>&gt;<i> custom lexical syntax, and benign annotations for tools here.]
