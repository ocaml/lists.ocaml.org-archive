It is certainly a good idea to do some benchmarks with the -ppx, I'll 
try to find some time to do so.

*If* performance is not satisfactory,  one should then identify the 
respective contributions of:

  1. Marshaling / demarshaling AST on the process boundaries.
  2. Spawning new processes.
  3. Traversing the AST with the ast_mapper class (overhead of method 
dispatch) and rebuilding a new AST in memory.

I doubt 3 would be a problem even with a lot of ppx rewriters, 
especially because they can be native code programs on platforms which 
support ocamlopt (even if native dynlink is not supported). *If* 1 or 2 
become a bottleneck,  one should indeed consider ways to avoid them.

The current version of ast_mapper:

<A HREF="http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/ocaml/trunk/parsing/ast_mapper.mli?view=markup">http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/ocaml/trunk/parsing/ast_mapper.mli?view=markup</A>

provides a very simple &quot;registration&quot; API:

=========================================================================
val register_function: (string -&gt; (string list -&gt; mapper) -&gt; unit) ref

val register: string -&gt; (string list -&gt; #mapper) -&gt; unit

     (** Apply the [register_function].  The default behavior is to run
         the mapper immediately, taking arguments from the process
         command line.  This is to support a scenario where a mapper is
         linked as a stand-alone executable.

         It is possible to overwrite the [register_function] to define
         &quot;-ppx drivers&quot;, which combine several mappers in a single
         process.  Typically, a driver starts by defining
         [register_function] to a custom implementation, then lets ppx
         rewriters (linked statically or dynamically) register
         themselves, and then run all or some of them.  It is also
         possible to have -ppx drivers apply rewriters to only specific
         parts of an AST.  *)
=========================================================================

The main program of a typical ppx tool would look like:


let mapper _args =
    object
       inherit Ast_mapper.mapper
       method! expr = ...
    end

let () = Ast_mapper.register &quot;foo&quot; mapper


When linked as a stand-alone program, this produces something which can 
be readily used as a -ppx rewriter.  But it is also possible to create 
&quot;ppx drivers&quot; which link code as above statically or dynamically (and 
then decide to run it or not).  It would even be possible to provide a 
hook in the compiler so as to make it possible (through compiler-libs) 
to link statically custom versions of ocamldep.opt / ocamlc.opt / 
ocamlopt.opt with statically linked &quot;ppx rewriters&quot; (avoiding any 
marshaling of the AST or any extra process).  I can imagine that for 
huge code base, this could be considered.
