That's about right.

&gt;<i>But fundamentally, I still don't agree that there is a clear separation 
</I>&gt;<i>between &quot;extension code&quot; and &quot;program code&quot;.  In particular, an 
</I>&gt;<i>extension might very well use a third-party library (e.g. an XML parser) 
</I>&gt;<i>or share some code with the target program. 
</I>
Yes, it is not a hard separation between the two.

Why should we enforce a 
&gt;<i>strong separation, in particular if this implies some ad hoc rules in 
</I>&gt;<i>the compilers?
</I>
My proposal was for a system that made extensions simple for non-experts. I 
think that it is easier to explain that extensions are like 
mini-preprocessors that live in &quot;.mlq&quot; files, than to explain that they are 
normal functions, but you can't use them in the same module, and you 
shouldn't include them in a module intended for run-time execution, and the 
side-effects of running the function will not be preserved etc.

Note that Haskell does not have the last two conditions because it manages 
all side-effects.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Would the code for .mlq would be compiled manually before its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expanders can be used, or would this compilation happen automatically?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They would need to be compiled, just like &quot;.mli&quot; files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>They contain code, so I guess you meant: just like &quot;.ml&quot; files?
</I>
I meant that they were like &quot;.mli&quot; files in that they must be compiled 
before a module that refers to them can be compiled.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Which technology would then be used to run this code (Dynlink, static
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> linking, toplevel-like technology for in-process compilation/execution)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Probably the same technology as the top-level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This seems to contradict the &quot;need to be compiled&quot; above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sorry, I meant the technology that the top-level uses to do &quot;#load&quot; 
directives. This is probably the same as Dynlink.
