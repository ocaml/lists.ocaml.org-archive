As I see it, the problem is not that the code for the extension is in a 
module, but that it is in a module which will be linked with your target 
program.  You propose to avoid any such potential confusion by 
segregating those modules which contain extension code from other 
&quot;regular modules&quot;.  Conceptually, this is not very different than 
choosing a module prefix (e.g. &quot;pb_&quot;, the successor of &quot;pa_&quot;) and simply 
ensuring in the compiler that they refuse to link pb_* modules into 
programs; those module can only be loaded (dynamically?) in a specific 
context (a particular &quot;ppx&quot; driver). It's just that you declare that 
these pb_* units are not real modules (and introduce a specific file 
extension instead of a prefix).

But fundamentally, I still don't agree that there is a clear separation 
between &quot;extension code&quot; and &quot;program code&quot;.  In particular, an 
extension might very well use a third-party library (e.g. an XML parser) 
or share some code with the target program.  Why should we enforce a 
strong separation, in particular if this implies some ad hoc rules in 
the compilers?

They contain code, so I guess you meant: just like &quot;.ml&quot; files?

&gt;&gt;<i> Which technology would then be used to run this code (Dynlink, static
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linking, toplevel-like technology for in-process compilation/execution)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the same technology as the top-level.
</I>
This seems to contradict the &quot;need to be compiled&quot; above.
