</I>
Is there a reason that ocamlbuild has to spawn the compiler for each file?
Couldn't it use compiler-libs to perform the compilation directly, and re-use some of the cached information (location of modules, parsed interfaces for example)?

Also I've noticed some suboptimal behaviours with oasis+ocamlbuild+ocamlfind, would that new wg-build list be appropriate to discuss such issues (and find solutions)?
Or should I just file bugreports for the individual tools?

For example:
 - ocamlfind returning -I paths in different order (with different -tag), which caused ocamlbuild to think that the &quot;build command&quot; has changed, and thus rebuild files it shouldn't
 - oasis sometimes adds more -I than necessary (if two libraries share a directory)
 - oasis sometimes adds too few -I (causing interface mismatch errors between my src/ and test/ for example)
 - even when there's nothing to rebuild it takes 1-2s to say that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; For a code base like Jane Street's where many &quot;extensions&quot; have to be used everywhere, I suspect that the &quot;independent&quot; ppx processes might become an issue (or maybe not, if compared to camlp4),

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This worked well in the case of Mirage; in the monolithic repository, we link together all the camlp4 extensions into a single big one, and invoke that across all files.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There's also the advantage in camlp4 that this checks that syntax extensions do not conflict. This is less of an issue with ppx, thankfully.
