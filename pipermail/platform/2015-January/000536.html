<PRE>You're making important points; this is an area where pragmatism is way above consistency or simplicity of design, just because the one direction it'll have to scale is users.

&gt;<i> &gt; * this is not focused on advanced users with multiple switches,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   etc. and it makes the configuration simpler to understand and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   edit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fair, although it would be a lot better if this created dot files that
</I>&gt;<i> were suitable for people who wanted to extend to more advanced use
</I>&gt;<i> later.  Setting up emacs files and the like is quite painful, even for
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated users, and I think a lot of them would appreciate the
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>
Agreed: best if it can be scaled to the needs of more advanced users without having to restart configuring from scratch, let's not add more steps than needed.

&gt;<i> &gt; * user-setup configures editors depending on what is installed in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the current switch ; it may not make sense in other switches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm tempted to think that this is a mistake, as I said in my previous
</I>&gt;<i> email.  I think we'd probably get a more readable and robust set of
</I>&gt;<i> emacs configs if they just auto-detected what was there, and
</I>&gt;<i> conditionally enabled those bits of editor automation.
</I>
Hmm, I was afraid of writing something that could get inconsistent, but indeed, if possible, there is no good reason not to add the detection code in the editor itself. Tool-configuration snippets may still be useful in some cases (less versatile editors), but it's best to put as much as possible in the base snippet for the editor.

&gt;<i> &gt; * some tools are generally useful (tuareg, ocp-indent) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   installing them in one switch should be enough. There is a clear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   distinction though for compiler-version dependent tools (merlin,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   ocp-index).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, that's a good point.  I think I'd personally prefer to just
</I>&gt;<i> install tuareg and ocp-indent and the like in all my switches, and
</I>&gt;<i> have merlin and ocp-index work properly as I switch.<A HREF="https://github.com/AltGr/opam-user-setup">https://github.com/AltGr/opam-user-setup</A>
</I>
Nothing is actually preventing us from being static for the first class of tools (tuareg, indent), and dynamic for the second class (compiler-specific ones), except maybe complexity and readability. I'd like to have similar (dynamic) code for all, but then set a static path for first-class tools so that it'll still work if you don't install them everywhere.

&gt;<i> &gt; * this approach is guaranteed to be available for all editors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we should do something more custom for individual editors.  We
</I>&gt;<i> could just have different packages for different editors, vim-support,
</I>&gt;<i> sublime-text-support, emacs-support, etc, which had some useful
</I>&gt;<i> dot-files and a setup script for them.  I'm not sure a one-size-fits-all
</I>&gt;<i> -editors approach is going to really be possible here.
</I>
I'd still like to try: there is an (editor x tool) matrix that can quickly gain in size, and gathering everything at a single place will really help maintaining various combinations, or at least knowing were to search. If it explodes in size, we can still start referring to other packages.

&gt;<i> If we get user-setup to install a robust set of emacs (or vim, or
</I>&gt;<i> sublime text...) macros, there isn't really a switch problem.  After
</I>&gt;<i> all, my current emacs configs work fine when I flip between different
</I>&gt;<i> switches.  If all user-setup is a set of configs to install such
</I>&gt;<i> robust scripts, we're in a pretty good place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, maybe we should focus on building highly robust
</I>&gt;<i> scripts first, and then just have an easy delivery mechanism for those
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in opam.
</I>
That's indeed my goal, maybe I over-engineered the tool. But I am also concerned with the convergence for such scripts: everyone typically tends to have his or her own tailored version of the editor configuration, and is generally reluctant to swap it for one in n integrated solutions, so it's really important to manage and focus the effort somewhere for establishing and testing these files.

I just updated the README at <A HREF="https://github.com/AltGr/opam-user-setup">https://github.com/AltGr/opam-user-setup</A> to reflect these thoughts in one place (it's by no means the end of discussion)

Best,
Louis
