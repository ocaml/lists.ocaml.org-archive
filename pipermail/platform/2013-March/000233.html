I agree that this would have to be solved, though I think this is
worth doing.  You'd need some kind of lookup from the easy to find
file (e.g., core_list.cmi) to the hard-to-find file (list.ml).

But I think this is work worth doing.

&gt;<i>  - Generic rules (e.g. in Makefiles) are more difficult to write.
</I>
This doesn't seem like much of an issue, since you can feel free to
simply use unique file-names if you'd like to.  This is merely an
option for developers who want to organize things in this way.  In the
end, I think it won't matter most of the time, because I hope that as
we develop better build tools, they will handle this stuff
automatically.

But if people want, they can name things uniquely and use simple
Makefiles.

&gt;<i>  - You can deploy compiled files for several libraries in the same
</I>&gt;<i> directory, but not the corresponding .mli files (for documentation purpose).
</I>
I think this is fairly poor practice.  Directory structures are useful
anyway, and one might as well encourage their use.

And again, the fully-qualified names would be available, if people
wanted to use them.  But I think OPAM should organize things into
directories, and keep the names of the files in those directories
short.
