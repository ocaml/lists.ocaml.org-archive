<PRE>One aspect of Leo's proposition that I found lacking is the absence of
a precise framework that could explain the semantics of the proposed
features and study their combination.

In our spec.pdf document, we have a single namespace description
language that is specified rather precisely, and is used to explain
all the semantic phenomenons that are currently scattered in
documentation about &quot;where the compiler looks for compilation units&quot;.
We capture this precisely as a &quot;compilation environment&quot;: whatever
conventions we adopt for namespace lookup is explained as producing a
namespace description that is taken as the compilation environment in
which the program's semantics is understood. The current command-line
argument -I, for example, is explained in term of the &quot;scan&quot; primitive
(scanning the filesystem for compilation units in a precisely
explained filename-dependent way) and the &quot;merge&quot; primitive (combining
two compilation environments again in a precisely specified way).

(Note that this doesn't mean that the whole namespace description
language has to be exposed to end-users. Some parts of it can be
referred to only internally to explain built-in conventions and
features.)

Concretely, the proposal as it is currently phrased left me wondering:
- how to compose different &quot;search path files&quot; (by concatenation, I
assume; I regret the absence of any conflict handling considerations)
- whether &quot;-open&quot; arguments would still be opened in absence of the
corresponding &quot;open namespace Core&quot; (it looks like &quot;yes&quot;, and that
would be a semantics change wrt. the discussed flat-access feature)
- what happens when you write &quot;open namespace Croe&quot;, making a typo
- whether each build system would have to implement its own way to
describe which -name option are supposed to be passed to which files;
it would be natural to pass them a description of the expected final
compilation environment (mapping module names to compilation units),
but in presence of -name you need to provide another mapping from
needed-.cmi names to corresponding-.ml names, and each build system
would need to come with its own description language for these &quot;send
all foo/&lt;bar&gt;.ml to foo-&lt;bar&gt;.cmi&quot; (which looks awfully like a
namespace description language)

On a rather orthogonal point, the proposal doesn't explicitly mention
the problem of internal module name conflicts. I assume that the
solution is &quot;-name&quot;, meaning that the library authors must make sure
that the -name option they pass (or the source filename) will be
unique among all modules used by their downstream users. As it is an
important responsibility, I think this should be emphasized.

</I>&gt;<i> Another thing which may not be obvious is that one sometimes in the

</I>&gt;<i> Being able to control this only at the file level, and only from
</I>&gt;<i> within the build system, is a poor match for our needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that one should write:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> open Core.Std
</I>&gt;<i> open Async.Std
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in a specific order does not strike me as a particular problem, and
</I>&gt;<i> even if it were, the solution I think would not be to stuff it into
</I>&gt;<i> the build system, but to build a single namespace that opened both
</I>&gt;<i> Core and Async.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the proposal lands in the way Leo describes, I would think we would
</I>&gt;<i> write a ppx extension that, for a certain whitelist of namespaces,
</I>&gt;<i> would convert:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    open namespace Core
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    open namespace Core
</I>&gt;<i>    open Core#Common
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that this is easy enough to do at the ppx level, I find it hard
</I>&gt;<i> to see what difficulties would be raised by integrating this with the
</I>&gt;<i> namespace system.  I understand that it feels mildly unsanitary
</I>&gt;<i> because on the implementation end the two things are quite different,
</I>&gt;<i> but from a user point of view, I think it's very much the right thing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where &quot;core.mlpath&quot; is a search path description file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then Async would include a description including something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     path := ./async.mlpath
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     path-depends := core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open := Async#Common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open-depends := core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where &quot;async.mlpath&quot; is a search path description file that includes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Core#Original#*: Core#*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Core#Gc: Async#Gc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Core#Condition: Async#Condition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where &quot;Gc&quot; and &quot;Condition&quot; are the components of Core that Async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-implements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would mean that commands equivalent to any of the following would all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produce the correct default environment for using Async:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ocamlc -package async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ocamlc -package async -package core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ocamlc -package core -package async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is preferable to requiring all users of Async to start their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open Core.Std
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open Async.Std
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is not something that a user might naturally assume was required.
