<PRE>Yesterday I had a discussion with Didier R&#233;my around the question of
how to deal with &quot;open module&quot; as part of a &quot;namespace language&quot; to
describe the compilation environment of OCaml programs.

# &quot;open&quot; explained through the namespace description language

In the model of <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf,">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf,</A>
&quot;compilation environments&quot; are maps from compilation unit names to
compilation units (as paths in the filesystem) or, in a hierarchical
setting, to subenvironments with the same structure.

As we have already remarked on this list, `open namespace Foo` can be
understood in terms of the corresponding namespace description
language. If the current environment is `E`, the environment after the
action of `open namespace Foo` is `E merge right E#Foo`; it is only
accepted if `Foo` is a subenvironment, and adds all its children to
the current mapping `E`, giving precedence over the new bindings in
case of conflict (to mimic the silent shadowing rule).

In a similar vein, one could wish to explain `open module M`
(the usual `open M` of OCaml, written `open module` to
avoid ambiguities) under the same light, turning `E` into `E merge
right E#M`.

But our specification only defines (sub)environments with
(sub)environments, not environments with modules. To model `open` in
this way we should extend the semantics of `merge`, by defining which
kind of semantic environment value the term `E merge right E#M` will
reduce to.

Methodology remark:

  There has been a discussion of how to treat &quot;open module&quot;
  information as part of namespace descriptions. Just having &quot;open
  Foo&quot; lines in the description and saying nothing else about it that
  &quot;this means the type-checker will have to perform this open before
  running on the program&quot; means that they are handled as
  *side-effects* of namespace descriptions. On the contrary, our
  previous models of namespaces described namespace *values*: a file
  foo.ns is semantically interpreted as building a datastructure that
  represents the namespace. I insist that this &quot;value&quot; model is better
  than mixing environment values (hierarchies, aliases, etc.) with
  side-effects, as this latter choice raises unpleasant design
  questions (if you include a namespace description file, does that
  also trigger its side-effects?). We're looking for a model of what
  the &quot;environment value&quot; are that takes `open module` seriously.

  The previous proposal was to enrich our current notion of
  environment values, namely map from names to either compunits or
  subenvironments, with &quot;flat access&quot; marks on some of the
  children. But then you need to have ordered mapping, or at least
  order the flat-access marks, and none of those solutions feel right.

# Values-inside-environments as a &quot;transparent&quot; model with some problems

A possible direction is to extend compilation environments to whole
typing environments, that can not only associate compilation unit
names to compilation units, but also usual value names (prefixed by
a compunit name) to OCaml values (or their types), types to type
definitions, etc. This has been suggested by a few people on the list
already.

For example, `Stdlib merge Stdlib#List` would result in a namespace
value of the following form

    { Array =&gt; &quot;+array&quot;,
      List =&gt; &quot;+list&quot;,
      ...
      ('a list) =&gt; type,
      (@) =&gt; ('a list -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list),
      ...
    }

However, this direction appears to be in contradiction with a design
choice we made early in our work on namespaces: we will explain
namespaces as mapping to compilation units, but no further, and in
particular, it will never be necessary to &quot;look into&quot; .cmi files to
understand and analyze a namespace description, or reduce it to
a &quot;value&quot; (for some notion of environment value). In our example, we
have to inspect &quot;+list.cmi&quot; to even be able to list the set of names
exported by the namespace description `Stdlib merge Stdlib#List`.

This restriction is valuable in particular for tooling purposes: not
looking into the .cmi content also means that you can designate
compilation units that do not exist yet, and have a single namespace
description that ranges over both already-existing units and
yet-to-be-compiled ones.

One particular kind of tooling that does not yet exists but we took
into account in our design is tools to interpret and analyse the
namespace descriptions themselves. You want to be able to tell wether
two distinct namespace descriptions risk shadowing each other, to
reason on whether a change you made kept the namespace description
equivalent (eg. changing the order of two merges), get the list of all
names exported by a given namespace description, etc.

In this respect, the namespace description language described in
spec.pdf or much others proposals made in the thread or elsewhere are
fairly simple to analyse statically, by themselves -- except for the
&quot;scan&quot; primitive that explicitly depends on the state of the
filesystem at a given time, and surely its use should be considered
prudently.

Adding lowercase names to the domain of compilation environments would
(partially) break those toolability properties. If you assume you
cannot access the relevant .cmi files or want to be resilient to any
of their change, you can still tell about compilation unit name
conflicts, but basically have no idea of which lowercase names are
exported by any given namespace description that uses `open
module`. You can define fine-grained semantic operations
(restricting the set of names added by the `open`, removing some
of them), but will not be able to check for conflicts or their
absence.

We therefore think it is a dangerous direction to move towards to,
that should be discouraged. Namespaces are planned for large-scale
organization of big software systems, being able to manipulate and
analyze them *independently* of the underlying type system details is
likely to be important for robustness.

We call this model (of semantic values for namespace descriptions) the
&quot;transparent model&quot;, because it looks through .cmi files to
incorporate values of the language into the compilation environment.


# An &quot;opaque&quot; model that is simpler

We propose a simpler model that can be seen as an abstraction of the
&quot;transparent model&quot;: instead of having values be mappings with rich
domain (both compilation unit names and in-language names), we suggest
a pair of:
  - an unordered mapping of compilation unit names to compilation
units, as before
  - an ordered list of compilation units, denoting the &quot;opened&quot;
modules; the &quot;open list&quot;

The namespace descrition `Stdlib merge Stdlib#List` would for example
reduce to the following value:

    { Array =&gt; &quot;+array&quot;,
      List =&gt; &quot;+list&quot;,
      ...
    }, [ &quot;+list&quot; ]

In a sense, we went away from the distasteful &quot;ordered mapping&quot; model
by separating the two concerns, with a pair of the (unordered) mapping
structure and the ordered-by-nature list of module to open.

We can then define two *asymetric* merge operations:

- `(M1, O1) merge (M2, O2)` merges two (sub)environments into the
  expected `(Map.union M1 M2, O1 @ O2)`, concatenating the open lists
  (opens of the left-hand-side will be performed first, and therefore
  shadowed by opens of the right-hand-side)

- `(M, O) merge U` merge an environment and a compilation unit into
  `(M, O @ [U])`

This gives a robust semantics to both `open namespace` and `open
module` in term of transformation of environment values. When
beginning to process a given compilation unit, the type-checker has
built a compilation environment, first from the filesystem by
convention, then by possible compilation parameters, finally possibly
by inspecting the source file headers containing namespace
information, and it enters the type-checking world where opening .cmi
is a given, and can translate this compilation environment value into
an initial type-checking environment just by doing the open in
sequence, in the order you expect. If allowed by the final design,
local `open namespace` or `open module` would be understood in the
same way.

We call this the &quot;opaque&quot; model because, semantically, it doesn't look
into the .cmi content before type-checking time, which allows to
reason on the environment values of namespace description involving
not-yet-existing or rapidly changing compilation units. Of course, it
won't be able to tell you anything about shadowing at the value level
in the open-list part (only name conflicts and shadowing among
*compilation units*), and this is very explicit in the semantic model.

# Open lists in subenvironments

Note that subenvironments also have this pair structure, so children
of a tree may have open lists. For example, if Core provides me with
a namespace description &quot;core.ns&quot;, and Batteries with another
&quot;batteries.ns&quot;, and I decide to build the namespace

   { Core =&gt; include &quot;core.ns&quot;,
     Batteries =&gt; include &quot;batteries.ns&quot; }

to talk about both worldviews in an explicit way, this will reduce to
a environment value of the form

   { Core =&gt; { Std =&gt; .., List =&gt; ... }, [ &quot;.../std&quot; ]
     Batteries =&gt; { ... }, [ &quot;.../batPervasives&quot; ] },
   []

Setting this as the compilation environment of a program will not
automaticaly open the &quot;std&quot; compilation unit provided by core: the
root open-list is empty. However, calling &quot;open namespace Core&quot; in
this setting will do that (as indicated by our semantics for `merge`).


# Operations on the open list

It may make sense to add some operations besides &quot;merge&quot; to manipulate
the open lists of namespaces, for example to empty it (I may want to
be able to denote the modules provided by Core with a short name, yet
avoid opening Std automatically, as the current -nopervasives
command-line option allows for the standard library), or explicitly
restrict its content by whitelisting or blacklisting.

Whatever choice we make in this design space, it is interesting to
consider how they project into the &quot;transparent&quot; semantics: we can
have a look at what in means in term of those rich, ideal but painful
to work with &quot;transparent&quot; environments, to make sure that all we're
doing really makes sense.
