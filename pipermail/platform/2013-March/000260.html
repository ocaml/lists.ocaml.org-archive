I agree that would be better for the stdlib case, and in some other
cases as well.  I suspect once we have namespaces, we may do just
what you propose.

But sometimes, shadowing is just what the doctor ordered.  For
example, I very much like the idiom of doing:


   let open Result.Monad_infix in
   ....

as a way of changing the monadic operators in force in some local
scope.  And I think there's something to be said for uniformity.
Shadowing is the order of the day in OCaml, and having namespaces
behave materially differently in this regard is going to be
surprising.

My primary point isn't that shadowing is good, though.  I do
understand the problems of shadowing, and having warnings for
shadowing seems reasonable.

My main point is that namespace control should by and large be
explicit in the source --- e.g., choosing whether or not you open the
Async#Common module in the build system is problematic, because it
hides this very salient semantic fact from the reader of the program.
