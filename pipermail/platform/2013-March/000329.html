</I>
[pardon me if this has been discussed before, I'm just jumping in the 
conversation and likely don't understand all the issues]

I don't think it would require namespaces to have closed definitions, 
which would defeat their purpose. It would only require to know which 
libraries are being *used* by the current source file (library = ordered 
collection of modules within the same namespace; different libraries can 
use the same namespace).

The following seems fairly natural to me:
1. have an &quot;import&quot; keyword or similar for specifying which libraries 
are being used, the order of the imports defining module order
2. open namespaces and modules at will

Point 1 defines locally the order of the visible modules without 
requiring the namespaces to be closed. Also, it makes the program's 
dependencies explicit and makes standalone programs self-buildable.

import Theirnamespace.Theirlibrary
import Othernamespace.Otherlibrary
import Theirnamespace.Somelibrary

(* assuming:
    - auto-open of the above libraries
    - no such thing as &quot;open namespace&quot;
*)

open ModuleA
   (* look for ModuleA it in Theirnamespace.Somelibrary,
      then in Othernamespace.Otherlibrary and finally in
      Theirnamespace.Theirlibrary *)

open Othernamespace#ModuleA
   (* open ModuleA provided by Othernamespace *)
