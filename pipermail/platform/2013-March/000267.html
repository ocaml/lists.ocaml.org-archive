<PRE>&gt;<i> Having
</I>&gt;<i> namespace opening be a special-case thing that only happens on the
</I>&gt;<i> file level and that is hidden from the source just seems like an
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate special-casing of a namespace manipulation tool (like let
</I>&gt;<i> and open) that should be available generally.
</I>
Just to be clear I'm not proposing to have namespace opening at file
level, just the hidden opening of modules.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the awkwardness is more related to how you treat things like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Core#Foo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where Foo might be a sub-module of Core#Common.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you elaborate a bit?  Why is this case problematic?  I can kind of
</I>&gt;<i> see why this is weird, but other than making an explicit requirement
</I>&gt;<i> of having an ordered semantics (which to me seems like the right
</I>&gt;<i> answer anyway, since it's more in tune with how OCaml's other
</I>&gt;<i> namespace manipulation operators work), it seems fairly
</I>&gt;<i> straight-ahead.  But I'm probably missing something important.
</I>
We should propbably stop calling this idea &quot;auto-opening&quot; because it is
really about allowing modules to be &quot;included&quot; within a namespace. This
is not a small change to the semantics. Without &quot;auto-opens&quot; namespaces
are simply a mechanism for controlling the names of compilation units,
with them they become a partial replacement modules: able to contain
values, types, exception, etc. Having two different features that
substantially overlap is normally a bad idea since it can cause a lot of
confusion.

Without auto-opens the namespace system is completely oblivious to the
actual contents of modules. With auto-opens the compiler must look
inside modules to work out whether &quot;Core#Foo&quot; refers to a member of Core
or a sub-module of one of its auto-opened modules.

Also, an ordered semantics is not for free. It makes having a
namespace defined in multiple places (as with users adding to existing
namespaces) much more fragile.

I think this is why people are reluctent to include automatically opened
modules in the namespaces proposal: it is quite a large change to the
semantics to handle a problem that is only likely to affect a few
libraries.

However, I think that I can see a way to avoid the problems of an ordered
semantics and possible &quot;Core#Foo&quot; conflicts.

The basic idea is to define a module named &quot;Core&quot; containing the values
that you would like automatically opened, as well as a namespace named
&quot;Core&quot;. Then you provide some kind of opening operation that opens both
the namespace and the module named &quot;Core&quot;.

This avoids the problem of ordering members of namespaces, since there
should only be one module called &quot;Core&quot;. Technically there could be
multiple &quot;Core&quot; modules in the search path, but we simply use the first
one we find just like normal modules.

It also avoids the issue of &quot;Core#Foo&quot; conflicts, since &quot;Core#Foo&quot; must
refer to the &quot;Foo&quot; member of the &quot;Core&quot; namespace, while &quot;Core.Foo&quot;
would refer to the &quot;Foo&quot; sub-module of the &quot;Core&quot; module.

This could be added to a namespaces proposal in a number of ways. For
example we could allow modules named &quot;Core#_&quot; (or core-_.ml) to be
defined. These modules could be refered to directly in programs as
&quot;Core&quot;. When the compiler encouters a &quot;open namespace Core&quot; construct it
first opens the &quot;Core&quot; namespace, and then it searches for a module
named &quot;Core#_&quot; and opens that as well.

Leo
