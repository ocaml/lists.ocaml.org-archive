<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why can't we have the same clear ordering everywhere for namespaces?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's wrong with having namespaces take on the same kind of ordered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantics that modules have?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would require namespaces to have closed definitions. This would
</I>&gt;<i> require a completely different model from the one I have proposed. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be less flexible, less powerful, less lightweight, and probably
</I>&gt;<i> harder to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>...

&gt;<i> A closed definition is one of the constraints forced on modules by their
</I>&gt;<i> need to be represented at run-time as a record. One of the motivations
</I>&gt;<i> for namespaces is to provide a system for containing modules that is not
</I>&gt;<i> bound by these restrictions. I don't see it as looking for a break with
</I>&gt;<i> the semantics of modules, so much as implementing a more flexible
</I>&gt;<i> semantics than what is possible with modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one thing I don't quite understand.  Yes, modules are implemented
</I>as records at runtime, but there's no requirement that namespaces have any
runtime representation; I don't see why they can't exist at compile time
only as something to make changes to the compilation environment when
invoked (open or # or whatever).  As far as the open/closed distinction,
hasn't gasche has gone over this; they can be treated as closed by the
compiler during compilation even if they're open all the rest of the time.
