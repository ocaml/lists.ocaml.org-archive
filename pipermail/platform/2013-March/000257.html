<PRE>I think if auto-open is a hard requirement there is no good way around
moving to an ordered model as Didier explained would be needed.

In this semantics, a namespace an ordered mapping from names to
subnamespaces or compilation units, with either (you can choose two
different, equivalent representations)
- some of them marked &quot;flat-access&quot; (the star in the graphical representation)
- an additional stack of unnamed subnamespaces and modules to auto-open

This makes the semantics less simple and elegant, but there is no way
around it we fundamentally on &quot;open&quot; as having a side-effect on the
environment. Ordering matters.

I think name shadowing through &quot;open&quot; is a very bad feature to abuse.
There are some cases where I don't see how to do without it (in
particular the Float.(a + b / c) style of local overloading of infix
operators is a sorely needed feature), but I think that it is wrong to
use it as a general organization principle&#185;, and that we should
instead promote ways to restrict the signature of a module or
namespace at open time (in particular substracting some names from it,
which cannot be expressed by the current signature language), and have
a stricter default policy regarding open shadowing. Ideally I'd like
something like Haskell's or Agda's &quot;lazy conflict failure&quot;, that by
default raises an error as soon as an ambiguous/shadowed name is
*used* in the program.
Note that the rant in this paragraph is not in contradiction with
using an ordered semantics to support the user bases that abuse name
shadowing.

&#185;: any unrestricted &quot;open&quot; of a third-party library makes the code in
scope not robust to extension of this library, shadowing names from
the outer context. To support upward-compatibility we should strive to
remain monotonic with respect to external code.

</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and to say the obvious: you may well want to specify opens of
