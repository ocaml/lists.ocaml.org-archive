Sorry, my terminology is perhaps a bit confusing.  The way I'm talking
about it, opening a module, opening a namespace and let bindings are
all manipulations of the program's name-space.  I guess that's a
terrible way of saying it.  Should I call those manipulations of the
naming enviroment?

In any case, I want to do as many environment manipulations in the
source as possible, and moving module opens to the build system seems
like a regression for our use-case.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the awkwardness is more related to how you treat things like:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    Core#Foo
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where Foo might be a sub-module of Core#Common.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you elaborate a bit?  Why is this case problematic?  I can kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see why this is weird, but other than making an explicit requirement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of having an ordered semantics (which to me seems like the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer anyway, since it's more in tune with how OCaml's other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace manipulation operators work), it seems fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straight-ahead.  But I'm probably missing something important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should propbably stop calling this idea &quot;auto-opening&quot; because it is
</I>&gt;<i> really about allowing modules to be &quot;included&quot; within a namespace. This
</I>&gt;<i> is not a small change to the semantics. Without &quot;auto-opens&quot; namespaces
</I>&gt;<i> are simply a mechanism for controlling the names of compilation units,
</I>&gt;<i> with them they become a partial replacement modules: able to contain
</I>&gt;<i> values, types, exception, etc. Having two different features that
</I>&gt;<i> substantially overlap is normally a bad idea since it can cause a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without auto-opens the namespace system is completely oblivious to the
</I>&gt;<i> actual contents of modules. With auto-opens the compiler must look
</I>&gt;<i> inside modules to work out whether &quot;Core#Foo&quot; refers to a member of Core
</I>&gt;<i> or a sub-module of one of its auto-opened modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, an ordered semantics is not for free. It makes having a
</I>&gt;<i> namespace defined in multiple places (as with users adding to existing
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces) much more fragile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is why people are reluctent to include automatically opened
</I>&gt;<i> modules in the namespaces proposal: it is quite a large change to the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics to handle a problem that is only likely to affect a few
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think that I can see a way to avoid the problems of an ordered
</I>&gt;<i> semantics and possible &quot;Core#Foo&quot; conflicts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea is to define a module named &quot;Core&quot; containing the values
</I>&gt;<i> that you would like automatically opened, as well as a namespace named
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Core&quot;. Then you provide some kind of opening operation that opens both
</I>&gt;<i> the namespace and the module named &quot;Core&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This avoids the problem of ordering members of namespaces, since there
</I>&gt;<i> should only be one module called &quot;Core&quot;. Technically there could be
</I>&gt;<i> multiple &quot;Core&quot; modules in the search path, but we simply use the first
</I>&gt;<i> one we find just like normal modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also avoids the issue of &quot;Core#Foo&quot; conflicts, since &quot;Core#Foo&quot; must
</I>&gt;<i> refer to the &quot;Foo&quot; member of the &quot;Core&quot; namespace, while &quot;Core.Foo&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> would refer to the &quot;Foo&quot; sub-module of the &quot;Core&quot; module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be added to a namespaces proposal in a number of ways. For
</I>&gt;<i> example we could allow modules named &quot;Core#_&quot; (or core-_.ml) to be
</I>&gt;<i> defined. These modules could be refered to directly in programs as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Core&quot;. When the compiler encouters a &quot;open namespace Core&quot; construct it
</I>&gt;<i> first opens the &quot;Core&quot; namespace, and then it searches for a module
</I>&gt;<i> named &quot;Core#_&quot; and opens that as well.
</I>
I think what you've come around to is pretty similar to what I had
intended in the first place when I was saying &quot;auto-open modules&quot;.  In
particular, you're proposing having a module &quot;Core&quot; associated with
the namespace &quot;Core&quot;, and that the two are automatically opened
together.  My thought was to do something that is only slightly
different from that: to be able to associated a list of modules L with
a namespace N, such that opening N automatically opens L.  That seems
broadly speaking less confusing and more flexible, rather than relying
on name collisions.

I think this specifies the role of modules in &quot;open namespace N&quot; and
&quot;let open namespace N in expr&quot;.  What seems to be in contention is the
semantics of N#M.  I think Leo and Alain are proposing that this be
limited to M being another module or namespace, and that it would
ignore the module opens.  I would have thought it more natural for N#M
to translate to &quot;let open namespace N in M&quot;, so that M could be either
a module or a value, and could be present in the namespace N or in the
list of modules that is auto-opened with N.

What is the argument in favor of the semantic distinction between N#M
and &quot;let open namespace N in M&quot;?
