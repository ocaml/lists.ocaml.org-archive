<PRE>&gt;<i> So the &quot;good&quot; mode for using ocamldep would be to have the build system generate a big search path file for each call to
</I>&gt;<i> ocamldep?
</I>
I would have thought that it would reuse the same search path file.

&gt;<i>   - How does the build system generate this search path file?  I guess it has to know about the &quot;simple namespaces&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> convention.  Does it?  And does it know about the &quot;-name&quot; arguments scattered around in many subdirectories.
</I>
Yes, the build system should now about the &quot;simple namespaces&quot;
convention, although it is a very simple convention (&quot;Foo#Bar :
foo-bar.cmi&quot;). If the build system provides support for alternative
naming conventions then it must also know about them.

&gt;<i>   - How this would work for non-namespaced modules?  Can you represent them with searh path files as in your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that search path files only defined namespaced names.
</I>
Search path files are allowed for any compilation unit. The whole idea
is that the &quot;search path files&quot; extension is completely independent of
the other extensions in my proposal (and vice-versa).

&gt;<i>   - If you assume that the build system can generate a search path file to avoid calling ocamldep (and thus the compiler
</I>&gt;<i> as well) with any -I 
</I>&gt;<i> directory, what's the point of supporting -I directories any more in the compiler and tools?
</I>
For backwards compatibility and convenience. For most projects, the
search path file would simply be a list of the contents of a directory
anyway.


&gt;&gt;<i> As a side note, I think that &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; should continue to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purely syntactic version that ignores the search path. It is regular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ocamldep that should be used for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I propose that &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; ignores the search path directories, but knows about the definition of namespaces.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, you need to invent a new convention to report possible namespaces together with each module dependency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; should return possible namespaces with
each module dependency. A tool that returns every possible compilation
unit mentioned in a file independent of its search path is probably
useful in general, not just for dependency generation. We can always add
a new mode that is half-way between &quot;ocamldep&quot; and &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot;
(i.e. uses the search path but still returns module names instead of
file names). An &quot;ocamldep -namespaces&quot; that returns all namespaces
mentioned might also be useful.


&gt;<i> And as said, even if you don't believe that is a viable approach for a robust build system, the same approach can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to add extra checks to existing build system that they don't miss dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You could still use such a tool on your own code base, just make sure
that you always use search path files instead of directories (which is
what you are proposing anyway).


&gt;&gt;<i> This kind of behaviour already exists in OCaml. Consider this piece of code:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      type t = Bar.t (* Bar only contains type definitions *)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you rename bar.mli to baz.mli but don't remove bar.cmi then it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to compile until you run &quot;make clean&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and I see it as a problem.  I would actually prefer a system where one must pass explicitly to the compiler the
</I>&gt;<i> list of files it can use, but this is not possible because of backward compatibility.  Since namespaces change the way
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml interact with the file system anyway and we have this nice notion of explicitly listing available units in
</I>&gt;<i> well-defined files (which can be used by other tools), I think it's a good opportunity to fix the existing problems
</I>&gt;<i> (partially).
</I>
My point is that since you are only fixing it partially, it is not a
good reason for excluding a feature. Especially when there is a clear
way to avoid the problem in your own code: always use search path
files.

Note that using an external library that uses &quot;simple namespaces&quot; will
not cause your own builds to have this problem.


&gt;<i> The average user who creates a library to be used by others will need to pick a good namespace
</I>&gt;<i> name and list which files constitute the library.  
</I>
This is not the case. I do not currently have to write a list of files
in my libraries. As I said, it depends on which build system you use.

&gt;<i> At this point, writing an explicit .mlpath file does not add any
</I>&gt;<i> burden (the same source of information can be used to define the
</I>&gt;<i> content of the library).
</I>
Note that you don't just have to write these files after you have
finished the library, you must maintain them throughout development.
