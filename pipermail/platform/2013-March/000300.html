<PRE>Following recent discussions, I would like to propose some changes to my
previous proposal:

## Flat namespaces

It has occured to me that, while I have some good use cases for
hierarchical namespaces, they are not critical for the *initial*
implementation of namespaces in OCaml. Essentially, I'm changing my
position from &quot;We should include support for hierarchical namespaces&quot; to
&quot;We should make sure that we could easily add support for hierarchical
namespaces in the future&quot;.

## Pervasive modules

I think that the simplest solution to Yaron's need for &quot;automatically
opened&quot; modules is to say that:

    open namespace Foo

will open the namespace Foo and then, if it exists, open the module
Foo#Pervasives. 

Members of Foo#Pervasives would not be accessible directly from Foo
(i.e. Foo#id != Foo#Pervasives.id).

I think this has the following benefits:

- This is basically a syntactic solution: we don't need to &quot;dirty&quot; the
  semantics or specification of modules with the issue of automatically
  opening modules.

- Only one Pervasives is opened, so conflicts between separate
  specifications of a namespace should be obvious immediately. Its
  relience on a specific name also makes the potential for conflicts
  obvious to users.

- It is clearly a bit of a fudge, which will discourage its excessive
  use, and prevent any percevied overlap bewteen namespaces and
  modules. This also makes it seem less &quot;offensive&quot; that it slightly
  breaks the idea that &quot;let open namespace Foo in id&quot; should be
  basically the same as &quot;Foo#id&quot;

- It fits in with the standard library's use of Pervasives. You could
  consider current behaviour as simply opening the &quot;Std&quot; namespace
  before every program.

I think that simple solution is better than trying to find a generalised
sematics for &quot;automatic opens&quot; in namespaces. As Gabriel's e-mail shows,
these semantics are non-trivial. I think that it is better to solve a
specific problem with a specific solution, rather than creating a
generalised solution for its own sake.

Regards,

Leo
