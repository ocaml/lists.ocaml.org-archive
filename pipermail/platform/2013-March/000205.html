<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) However, you cannot open several nodes at the same time without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     specifying an ordering between those nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does it mean to open several nodes &quot;at the same time&quot;?  I would
</I>&gt;<i> have thought that opening of nodes would always be ordered, since the
</I>&gt;<i> open statements would need to be written in some order.
</I>
If Core has two auto-open subnodes (e.g Std and Pervasives), then opening
core will open the two auto-open subnodes at the same time. This is what I
meant.

In this case, you write with the auto-open semantics

         open Core

and what happens is equivalent to (without the auto-open semantics)

         open Core
         open Std
         open Pervasives
or
         open Core
         open Std
         open Pervasives

So the edges Std and Pervasives need both leaving from Core need to be
ordered in the namespace.

&gt;&gt;<i> The * is the auto-open flag, as used in Gabriel's description.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for leaving this implicit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Got it.  That's quite helpful, though I'm still a little lost about
</I>&gt;<i> the problem you're describing.  It sounds to me like the issue dervies
</I>&gt;<i> from the fact that you're proposing opening up a parent namespace as
</I>&gt;<i> an operation that opens all children as well.  Is that right?
</I>
Yes, an operation that opens all children marked auto-open.

&gt;<i> I hadn't even begun to imagine wanting that feature, so maybe that isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> real issue at all?  Or perhaps I'm just confused....
</I>
I thought this is what you where asked for when saying that you want

         open Core

to behaves as

         open Core
         open Std
         open Pervasives

because you have marked Std and Pervasives as auto-open.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think namespaces should be unordered to scale up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You would like to be able to represent all available libraries in the OCaml
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world as a namespace, with libraries coming from many different sources and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no natural order on these, i.e. no order that could be given a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meaningful semantics.  Would you put World#JaneStreet before World#Lexify or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the other way round?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If name spaces are unordered, it is also easy to populate them by reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and merging different sources in a strict way: name spaces are meant to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoid conflicting names to start with, so if a merge introduces conflicts,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is really the right place to fix it by renaming one side or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reorganizing the hierarchy rather than do some silent overriding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this all comes down to different thoughts about hierarchy.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I wouldn't think the namespace World#JaneStreet would be
</I>&gt;<i> ordered compared to World#Lexify, but the module aliases and opens
</I>&gt;<i> contained in a namespace would, I thought, have been ordered.  And
</I>&gt;<i> surely, when you open multiple namespaces in your environment, you can
</I>&gt;<i> be including the same name multiple times, at which point I believe
</I>&gt;<i> the proper semantics is shadowing.
</I>
Here, you are reasoning in Alain's model where a namespace file is just a
sequence of operations (alias or open).  So you don't have a proper notion
of namespace model and instead understand a namespace file as its immediate
action on the current scope.

This is find to reason in the small, to reason about the imports of a
module source file.

But I don't think this is a good model that would scale to providing a
unified view of all available libraries where you wish to construct
namespaces a posteriori by combining existing ones.

&gt;&gt;<i> Hope this helps,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what I'm mostly confused about is what is the nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical namespace system you're thinking about. What are the
</I>&gt;<i> operations available?
</I>
The model is what has been described by Gabriel:

   <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf</A>

and

   <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/pack_et_functor_pack.html">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/pack_et_functor_pack.html</A>

&gt;<i> Do you intend to have namespace opens also recursively open all children?
</I>
I thought this was your wish.
But I think it is more a drawback than a convenience.

&gt;<i> Is there an operation for merging namespaces?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Aliasing upper namespaces?
</I>
Yes, you can have several paths leading to the same module object.

&gt;<i> Right now, I lack both a precise mental model of what you mean by
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical namespaces,
</I>
   <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> and an understanding of the language features that motivate this
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy.
</I>
Although you do not say it clearly, I think you wish at least Alain's
2-level hierarchal model.

This may be fine from your point of view:

         level 1 is for JaneStreet different libraries
         level 2 is for the modules of each library

Most of your libraries are for internal use. So in a way you do not have to
share your namespaces with the rest of the world. I think the problem comes
when people want to share the namespaces.

For instance, there could be two actors Foo and Bar proposing complementary
set of libraries for programming the web.

When doing web programming I may wish to use parts of both providers
Then, I may wish to structure names as

         Web
             Foo
                 Lib1
                    &lt;list of modules&gt;
                 Lib2
                    &lt;list of modules&gt;
             Bar

In the 2-level model I would be forced to rename namespace files
to avoid clashes and get some long list of namespace_files that would look
like:

         Web_Foo_Lib1
         Web_Foo_Lib2
         Web_Bar

In this model, the reorganization of namespaces exported by users Foo and
Bar has into my own view has to be done manually.  The fact that names carry
some implicit structure is an indication that one has some hierarchy in
mind.

In the hierachical view, it would suffice to assemble them within the
language of namespaces, using operations like merge, perhaps pruning, etc..

Besides, I do not think that a 2-level model is so much simpler than a
hierarchical one.  The apparent simplificty of Alain's proposal is more I
think in the fact that he does not manipulate namespaces explicitly (such as
pruning, merging, etc.)
