<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The main question whether namespaces are hierarchical or flat is still not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answered, Flat namespaces are not much of an extension to OCaml and do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raise many questions about their semantics.  This is the benefit of Alain's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal---but also its weakness to be limited in expressiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand the goal of full hierarchical models.  I
</I>&gt;<i> would have thought that flat namespaces that include auto-open modules
</I>&gt;<i> would be quite sufficient.
</I>
I thought you wanted a hierarchical model!
And you keep using hierarchical notation in your examples.

         open Core
         open Std
or
         open Core#Std

Isn't this hierarchical?
Do you mean hierarchical with just two levels?
If this what you mean by not being fully hierarchical?

But I don't think two levels or unbounded makes a significant difference,
technically.

&gt;<i> One difference of opinion that I do have is that my intuition about
</I>&gt;<i> shadowing and dependencies on orders of opens is the opposite of
</I>&gt;<i> yours.  In particular, shadowing of names seems quite ordinary in
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml, it's an expected part of the language, and I would prefer for
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces to share that property.  Indeed, places where shadowing of
</I>&gt;<i> names is not possible (modules, in particular) have been a point of
</I>&gt;<i> frustration for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My inclination is that if you have two namespaces that define the same
</I>&gt;<i> module, and you open them in sequence, the second should simply shadow
</I>&gt;<i> the first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     open namespace Core#Std   (* defines a UNIX module *)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ... some code that uses Core's UNIX ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     open namespace Async#Std  (* defines a different UNIX module *)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ... some code that uses Async's UNIX ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be quite distressed to find that the namespace system
</I>&gt;<i> prevented the second open on the ground that it shadowed something in
</I>&gt;<i> the first.  This is precisely the behavior I would want and expect!
</I>
I am not sure of what you exactly want.

In the simplest hierarchical model, namespaces are nodes of a graph whose
directed edges are names to access sub-namespaces (internal nodes)
or module objects (leaves).

In this model namespaces are not ordered, i.e. edges leaving from one node
are not ordered.

This is, I think, an easier model, because you can populate a namespace by
listing available module objects in a directory---which is not ordered.

In this model:

1) you can open a node, with either a strict semantics (detecting overrides)
    or an overriding semantics (given priority to the names coming from the
    open).

2) However, you cannot open several nodes at the same time without
    specifying an ordering between those nodes.

3) Hence, you cannot do auto-open if you have several auto-open edges
    leaving from the same node unless auto-open edges are ordered.

If wish to do (3) you would need to order edges (at least auto-open ones) in
the namespace. You may then wish all edges to be ordered.  However, I think
this is not a good model.  An intermediate option is to just order auto-open
nodes when you declare them.  This is better than ordering all nodes---we
may assume that auto-open nodes are few.  But this mixed model is more
complicated for the user.  (See at the end of this message while the fully
ordered model is not good in my opinion.)

&gt;&gt;<i>          ROOT . --Core--&gt; C --Pervasives*--&gt; M
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                            \
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                              --Std*--&gt; S
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize, but I just don't understand the example.  Is Pervasives a
</I>&gt;<i> module or a namespace?  I would assume it would be a module, since
</I>&gt;<i> I thought only modules are auto-open.  And what is the * for after Std
</I>&gt;<i> and Pervasives?
</I>
Here Pervasives is the name of the edge that goes from namespace C to the
module object M.  Core is the name of the edge that goes from the toplevel
name space to the sub-namespace C.  You have to distinct the name and the
object in the model.  You could have several paths leading to the same
object.

The * is the auto-open flag, as used in Gabriel's description.
Sorry for leaving this implicit.

&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps, an alternative to auto-open would be to allow one to write open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directives in .ns files as well. Then, a file myenv.ns could both build a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace and pre-open some of the nodes, including some of its leaves.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user could then just put something as concise as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          use myenv.ns
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the top of his *.ml files. And if he opens myenv.ns he will have a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clear idea of what names should be visible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just an idea, which I don't like so much either.  But is shows that there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are still important details to be thought of and choices to be made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would the declaration &quot;use myenv.ns&quot; differ from &quot;open namespace
</I>&gt;<i> Myenv&quot;?
</I>
Here Myenv is not a namespace but a file containing namespaces commands.
Some of the commands would build the environment, and my proposal is that
namespace file could also contain open commands.  (opening a name space can
be seen as the construction of a namespace, but opening a module cannot.)

&gt;<i> Are you proposing two different primitives, or would one only
</I>&gt;<i> have the &quot;use&quot; declaration?
</I>
This is syntax. The point is that auto-open complicates things and if the
only reason to have it is that you do not wish to repeat or have every user
write the sequence

         open Core (* that contains Pervasives, Std, etc. *)
         open Pervasives
         open Std

then you could disallow auto-opens and instead allow a namespace file
myenv.ns to also contain commands that open modules. They you would only
invoke this file (with whatever syntax to be chosen) at the beginning of
your .ml source files.

&gt;<i> I think my mental model of how namespaces should work is quite similar
</I>&gt;<i> to what you described above.  In particular, I would think that
</I>&gt;<i> opening a namespace would be the equivalent of adding a collection of
</I>&gt;<i> module aliases (possibly shadowing existing module names), and opening
</I>&gt;<i> some collection of modules (possible shadowing yet more module names
</I>&gt;<i> and other values).  All this should happen in whatever order is
</I>&gt;<i> described in the namespace definition file.
</I>
The last sentence means that namespaces objects are ordered in your mind.
Not in mine. In my (simplest) model, namespace objects are not ordered,
but open (module) directives are ordered.

&gt;<i> And in all of this, I view the dependency on order to be a feature,
</I>&gt;<i> not a bug.   OCaml is through and through full of this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> dependency, and I can see no justification for breaking that property
</I>&gt;<i> specifically with namespaces.  We like the behavior for values and
</I>&gt;<i> types, after all.  Why should namespaces be different?
</I>
I think you are talking about dependency on on the order when you open
things.  This need does not imply a dependency on the order or edges in the
namespace structure.  If you open things (namespaces or modules) one by one,
you need not order edges in the namespace structure.

----------------

I think namespaces should be unordered to scale up.

You would like to be able to represent all available libraries in the OCaml
world as a namespace, with libraries coming from many different sources and
there is no natural order on these, i.e. no order that could be given a
meaningful semantics.  Would you put World#JaneStreet before World#Lexify or
the other way round?

If name spaces are unordered, it is also easy to populate them by reading
and merging different sources in a strict way: name spaces are meant to
avoid conflicting names to start with, so if a merge introduces conflicts,
this is really the right place to fix it by renaming one side or
reorganizing the hierarchy rather than do some silent overriding.

When getting closer to the leaves, the situation is a bit different, because
nodes may all come from the same source/library.  Here, it may be desirable
(yet to be confirmed) to have auto-opens and thus introduce some ordering.
Ordering towards the leaves is less of a problem in practice and those name
spaces may be built by explicitly listing all components---rather than
scanning and merging different sources. So it seems ok in practice.  Still,
it implies optional ordering of edges and slightly complicates the mental
model.

Hope this helps,

     Didier
