<PRE>&gt;<i> Leo's model allows the build system to precisely set the order of default
</I>&gt;<i> opens, and tools such as ocamlfind could support this just as they do
</I>&gt;<i> include and link directives at the moment.  I know JS doesn't use
</I>&gt;<i> ocamlfind, but the moral equivalent could inject the command-line
</I>&gt;<i> directives very easily.
</I>
To expand on what Anil said, under my proposed system the idea is to push the
problem of providing &quot;pervasive&quot; modules into the build or package system.

For example, I would expect Core to provide some kind of package description
for OCamlFind or similar tool including something like (using made up
syntax):

    path := ./core.mlpath
    open := Core#Common

where &quot;core.mlpath&quot; is a search path description file.

Then Async would include a description including something like:

    path := ./async.mlpath
    path-depends := core
    open := Async#Common
    open-depends := core

where &quot;async.mlpath&quot; is a search path description file that includes:

    Core#Original#*: Core#*
    Core#Gc: Async#Gc
    Core#Condition: Async#Condition

where &quot;Gc&quot; and &quot;Condition&quot; are the components of Core that Async
re-implements.

This would mean that commands equivalent to any of the following would all
produce the correct default environment for using Async:

    ocamlc -package async
    ocamlc -package async -package core
    ocamlc -package core -package async

I think this is preferable to requiring all users of Async to start their
files with:

    open Core.Std
    open Async.Std

which is not something that a user might naturally assume was required.
