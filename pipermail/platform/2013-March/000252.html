</I>
One clarification on what you said earlier: I do think that this
feature is not strictly necessary to do what we did with Core vs the
OCaml stdlib.  We created a /new/ namespace that included things from
an existing namespace.  That's clearly necessary.  It's less obvious
to me that injecting things into a namespace that someone else created
is as important.

That said, I have no objections to the feature, as long as I can
prevent it from being used willy nilly within our own code.  (Thus, I
think I would object to source-level namespace declarations that the
build system had no say over.)
