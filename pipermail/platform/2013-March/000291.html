<PRE>I nm *very* happy to announce the first official release of OPAM!

Many of you already know and use OPAM so I won't be long. Please read <A HREF="http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/01/17/opam-beta.html">http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/01/17/opam-beta.html</A> for a longer description.

1.0.0 fixes many bugs and add few new features to the previously announced beta-release.

The most visible new feature, which should be useful for beginners with OCaml and OPAM,  is an auto-configuration tool. This tool easily enables all the features of OPAM (auto-completion, fix the loading of scripts for the toplevel, opam-switch-eval alias, etc). This tool runs interactively on each `opam init` invocation. If you don't like OPAM to change your configuration files, use `opam init --no-setup`. If you trust the tool blindly,  use `opam init --auto-setup`. You can later review the setup by doing `opam config setup --list` and call the tool again using `opam config setup` (and you can of course manually edit your ~/.profile (or ~/.zshrc for zsh users), ~/.ocamlinit and ~/.opam/opam-init/*).

Please report:

On behalf on the OPAM team,
Thomas

=== Install ===

Packages for Debian and OSX (at least homebrew) should follow shortly and I'm looking for volunteers to create and maintain rpm packages. The binary installer is up-to-date for Linux and Darwin 64-bit architectures, the 32-bit version for Linux should arrive shortly.

If you want to build from sources, the full archive (including dependencies) is available here:
   
   <A HREF="http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-latest.tar.gz">http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-latest.tar.gz</A>

=== Upgrade ===

If you are upgrading from 0.9.* you won't  have anything special to do apart installing the new binary. You can then update your package metadata by running `opam update`. If you want to use the auto-setup feature, remove the &quot;eval `opam config env` line you have previously added in your ~/.profile and run `opam config setup --all`.

So everything should be fine. But you never know ... so if something goes horribly wrong in the upgrade process (of if your are upgrading from an old version of OPAM) you can still trash your ~/.opam, manually remove what OPAM added in  your ~/.profile (~/.zshrc for zsh users) and ~/.ocamlinit, and start again from scratch. 

=== Random stats ===
