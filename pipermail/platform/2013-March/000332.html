</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would argue that this should push us towards making namespace-opens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well-defined in order by default.  I think that opening namespaces on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the command-line should be viewed as a largely second-class operation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and it would make sense in my mind to restrict it to a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace, which goes before everything else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the order of command-line namespace opens is another area where
</I>&gt;<i> shadowing may be risky, they are not what I am referring to here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is useful to be able to specify a namespace across multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> locations, for instance within two separate search path files. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ordering between &quot;automatically opened modules&quot; specified across these
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> multiple locations will not be well specified (probably depending on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> workings of your build system). This makes shadowing much riskier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see.  This is low on my list of priorities.  I would be happy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require namespaces to be specified all at once in a single location.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would ensure that namespaces always have a unique definition,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which seems to make life simpler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only for supporting multiple &quot;automatically opened modules&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But in any case, as long as namespace opens are well-defined and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespaces are well defined at the time of the open, I don't see the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Namespaces opens will be well-defined in the sense that they will have
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of order. But that order may well depend on the workings of
</I>&gt;<i> their build system, so they are not well defined in any meaningful
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I basically don't see where your belief that automatically opened
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> modules are semantically problematic and uncomposeable arises from.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Certainly, my experience with packed modules argues in the other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> direction. Do you propose to delete the possibility of shadowing from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the module language as well?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Modules are defined in a single location, and can only be composed using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;include&quot; statements. These include statements have a clearly defined
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ordering.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why can't we have the same clear ordering everywhere for namespaces?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's wrong with having namespaces take on the same kind of ordered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> semantics that modules have?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would require namespaces to have closed definitions. This would
</I>&gt;<i> require a completely different model from the one I have proposed. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be less flexible, less powerful, less lightweight, and probably
</I>&gt;<i> harder to use. In exchange you would be able to safely define multiple
</I>&gt;<i> auto-opened modules for each namespace (which I don't think anyone has
</I>&gt;<i> actually asked for).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My main criticism of all of this line of thinking is that it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like we're looking for a break of semantics between namespaces and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modules, rather than accepting such a break to the degree it comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A closed definition is one of the constraints forced on modules by their
</I>&gt;<i> need to be represented at run-time as a record. One of the motivations
</I>&gt;<i> for namespaces is to provide a system for containing modules that is not
</I>&gt;<i> bound by these restrictions. I don't see it as looking for a break with
</I>&gt;<i> the semantics of modules, so much as implementing a more flexible
</I>&gt;<i> semantics than what is possible with modules.
</I>
I think I understand your point now.  I don't have any objections
really to the semantics you propose here.
