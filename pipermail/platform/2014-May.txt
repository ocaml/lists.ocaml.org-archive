Subject: [ocaml-platform] Install OPAM in 2 minutes
Message-ID: <5364A129.4070504@t-online.de>

Hi,

I am new to ocaml.
A review in a magazine was so interesting that I want to try to use ocaml.

As recommended I started with installing OPAM.
The 2 minutes will take a little longer as I got the following message
after a
succesfull installation:

usr/local/bin/opam: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version
`GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /usr/local/bin/opam)

Where do get this library from?


KDJ.

May you tell which magazine?

This library is actually one of the fundamental blocs of your system.
Or are you still using a 32 bits OS?  If you use the latest Ubuntu
or Debian testing, opam is available as a package and you should use
your package manager to install it.

Hope it helps (if not, give more details about your system),

I've opened a ticket about this issue a few weeks ago:

https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1330


This kind of errors occurs because the binary version of OPAM has been 
compiled on a system with a more recent version of the libc than yours.

There are a number of measures which can be taken to make it more likely 
to have the binary distribution run an older systems.  For instance, 
compiling asmrun/startup.c with -D_GNU_SOURCE avoids a redirection from 
sscanf to __isoc99_sscanf for recent versions of glibc and thus makes 
libasmrun.a compatible with older versions of the glibc.  LexiFi had to 
do such tricks in the past to enable binary distribution of libraries 
including OCaml code.  I don't know if this would be enough to address 
the current problem.

One way to check that a distributed binary does not depend on recent 
glibc is to run "objdump -t" on the executable and check for 
...@@GLIBC_XXX suffixes.
