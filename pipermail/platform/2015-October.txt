Subject: [ocaml-platform] 4.02.3 ocamldoc breakage
Message-ID: <BC5FF65C43F74D49BB2EE20A4CE8DE8E@erratique.ch>

Would it be possible for someone knowledgeable to look into:   

   http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6964

and make a patch that we apply on the 4.02.3 switch (or another well advertised one).  

It's a very annoying bug that breaks documentation generation in many cases. This has the effect of *silently* and invisibly propagating to the online documentation of projects ? e.g docs on my website were already broken at least trice and you have to switch to an earlier version of ocaml to actually generate the docs.

It's not as if the documentation situation was already good in general in the OCaml world.

Best,

Daniel

In case this will save some future people some future time:

I seemed to be experiencing a similar, bot not identical problem. 
I had the following setup:

  - OS X: v 10.11
  - OPAM: v 1.2.2_1
  - wget: v 1.13.4

and when I attempted to update opam it looked like this:

```
$ opam update

=-=- Updating package repositories =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  ?
[ERROR] Could not update repository default
```

By following this thread, I got as far as running `opam update -vv`, 
but I did not receive the same illuminating information as OP. Instead 
I had this result:

[default: http] Command started
+ wget "--content-disposition" "--no-check-certificate" "-t" "3"
"https://opam.ocaml.org/1.1/urls.txt"
(CWD=/var/folders/45/45fn42f929169glfv0_ngbrw0000gp/T/opam-21935-dd682e)
- Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...
-
- Try `wget --help' for more options.
[ERROR] Could not update repository default 

tbh, I don't know what it was trying to indicate, but I guessed it was 
an issue with wget. I checked http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/ and learned
wget 1.13.4 was no longer current. So I ran

```
$ brew update
$ brew install wget
```

Which upgraded me to the latest version (1.16.3, at the time I write this).
Afterwards, `opam update` worked without a problem.

Thanks to all you problem solvers in this thread who helped me get this far. :)
