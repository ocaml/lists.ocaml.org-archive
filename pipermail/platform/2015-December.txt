Hi platform,

Would it be possible to create an ocamlbuild repository in the
github:ocaml organization, to host the ocamlbuild project as it is
split off the main OCaml distribution? @whitequark could be
co-{owner,maintainer,developer} of the repository.

Thanks

There's already a (private) ocaml/ocamlbuild repository which was created by Fabrice in Aug 2013 to prepare the eventual split (that's what I call forward vision! :p).

Fabrice, do you mind if I delete the repository and create a fresh one for Gabriel and @whitequark?

Best,
Thomas

Subject: [ocaml-platform] OPAM Install of ctypes-foreign fails silently
Message-ID: <1449242003.2934914.458092545.7F99007E@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello,

I'm try to install the package ctypes-foreign using OPAM. It looks like
it works, but actually nothing gets installed.

This is the command I used:

$ opam install ctypes ctypes-foreign
The following actions will be performed:
  ?  install ctypes-foreign 0.4.0
  ?  install ctypes         0.4.1
===== ?  2 =====

=-=- Gathering sources
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
[ctypes] Archive in cache

=-=- Processing actions
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
?  installed ctypes-foreign.0.4.0
?  installed ctypes.0.4.1
Done.

It looks like "ctypes" worked:

$ ocamlfind query ctypes
/home/robert/.opam/system/lib/ctypes


But ctypes-foreign wasn't installed:

$ ocamlfind query ctypes-foreign
ocamlfind: Package `ctypes-foreign' not found

I can see a directory /home/robert/.opam/system/lib/ctypes-foreign is
created, but it's empty.

I'm new to OPAM, so not sure how to begin debugging this. Any hints much
appreciated.

Many thanks,
Rob

That's the intended behaviour, since ctypes-foreign is just a virtual
package that determines whether the foreign subpackage should built as
part of ctypes.

> $ ocamlfind query ctypes-foreign

The opam package is called 'ctypes-foreign' (with a hyphen), but the
ocamlfind package is called 'ctypes.foreign' (with a dot), so the
command you need is

   ocamlfind query ctypes.foreign

Hi Thomas,

  You can. The only interesting part was how it was created by xtracting
the git history:

How this repository was created:

git clone git at github.com:ocaml/ocaml.git
cp -dpR ocaml ocamlbuild
cd ocamlbuild
git subtree split -P ocamlbuild -b next-ocamlbuild
git filter-branch --prune-empty next-ocamlbuild
git checkout next-ocamlbuild
git mv *.ml *.mli *.mll src
mkdir Attic
git mv Makefile* Attic
git mv ocamlbuild* Attic

(in branches/stripped-ocaml:
cp -dpR configure* m4 Makefile Makefile.config.in .gitignore
~/GIT/github/ocaml/ocamlbuild
cp -dpR scripts ~/GIT/github/ocaml/ocamlbuild/scripts
)

git add .gitignore
git add src/.depend
git add configure configure.ac m4/ax_compare_version.m4  m4/ocaml.m4
 Makefile Makefile.config.in scripts/tolower.sed

I've submitted an OPAM repository pull request to make this behaviour more obvious in the OPAM packages:

Just for this part you can replace these line by

git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter ocamlbuild -- --all

and all the tags and branches are filtered.

My two cents,

What's the next step on this? Gabriel, I can help if you'd like. I'm eager
to get the repo created as I have several issues to report.

Indeed, the repo is blank for now. I haven't taken the time to do this yet,
but will next week-end at the latest. In the meantime, feel free to use the
mantis bugtracker to report issue -- we will have to migrate them to github
in any case -- setting the "Target version" to "later".

I'll just wait to create the issues to avoid the extra work of porting them
from Mantis (I'm assuming that hasn't been automated). I'm tracking the
issues in my notes, so won't forget them.

Sorry I forgot to populate the repo last week.

It is now done. I couldn't follow the step given by Fabrice because I couldn't find the file copied, 
so I modified in my own way the Makefile of ocamlbuild so that it compiles alone.

6a7311b74a639f77868f8c2d25d74c46763bee24

It uses `$(ocamlc -where)/Makefile.config` so that it doesn't need a configure

I reverted the addition of "*_ascii" so that we can test ocamlbuild with 4.02.3.

There is many polishing to do, but the compilation infrastructure should work well enough for 
starting to contribute. I'm opening issues for the remaining tasks, travis being the main one.

Best,

One other thing we have to do is to get the issue tracker in shape. I'm not
decided on whether to set up an automated porting of Mantis issues into
Github, or try to take the opportunity to select the relevant issues that
we have a hope of solving and close the others. Option two sounds like much
more work (and I have very little time to spend on this right now), so
probably option one: automatic porting. Mantis easily gives a CSV datasheet
for custom selections, so the game would be to automate the creation of
issues on the github side.

The OCaml GitHub bindings in OPAM should have everything needed for this.  Let me know if there's anything missing from them or problems with the interface.

Subject: [ocaml-platform] OPAM with OCaml 4.02.1 dllllvm_stubs.so: undefined

Message-ID: <56815D70.2060109@uci.edu>

I get the fellowing error using the binary analysis platform (bap), a 
program analysis platform for binaries when trying to compile a byte 
code executable:

$ bapbuild hello_world.byte
+ ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -g -thread -syntax camlp4o -package re.posix

ocamlgraph -package variantslib.syntax -package fieldslib.syntax 
-package comparelib.syntax -package sexplib.syntax -package core_kernel 
-package bap.plugins -package bap hello_world.cmo -o hello_world.byte
File "_none_", line 1:
Error: Error on dynamically loaded library: 
/home/joshua/.opam/4.02.1/lib/stublibs/dllllvm_stubs.so: 
/home/joshua/.opam/4.02.1/lib/stublibs/dllllvm_stubs.so: undefined 
symbol: del_curterm
Command exited with code 2.

Apparently, dllllvm_stubs.so needs to be linked with the Terminfo 
library. How can I create or obtain that shared library with the 
Terminfo library linked?

Thanks,
Josh
