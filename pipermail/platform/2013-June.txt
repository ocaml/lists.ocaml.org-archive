I ran into OPAM Coq recompilation one time too many, and created a
(possibly alarmist) corresponding issue on the OPAM bugtracker:
  https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues/805


PS: Fran?ois, I hope you won't be offended by the frustrated tone of
the report. I very much appreciate the packaging work that you have
done (and contributions to the tool itself !). I just don't think that
OPAM is able to provide a good experience for the Coq package right
now, so it probably shouldn't be, in its present form, in the default
repository. I may also not be seeing the whole picture: if you or
others have clear use-cases for using the OPAM packages of, say,
Frama-C (as opposed to dumb binary releases for users and manual
compilation for developpers), it would be interesting to explain them
in the bugreport discussion.

Don't worry no offense taken. I didn't request a merge for the following 
commit (that extract coqide and its dependencies to another package and 
that would have saved your day) because it is more a hack than a real 
solution. I was looking for a better solution because I'm also 
frustrated ( today I have the pleasure to do opam upgrade
   - recompile camlp5.6.07 [upstream changes]
   - recompile coq.8.4pl1 [use camlp5]
)

Leaf project (in the dependency graph) like Frama-C are less a problem 
and since other project can depend on their libraries and binary 
(ex:Why2) its good to have them in opam. Moreover Frama-C takes only 
2min to compile.

Since OPAM is currently a conservative source-based package manager,
it's hard to escape recompiles of packages if something genuinely changes
upstream in the dependency chain.

The only solutions are to go OPAM more insight into the dependency graph
of package contents (which is ongoing, but will take some time), and
to break up packages into smaller chunks.

Therefore, I've updated your bug report with a request for Fran?ois's
split package for Coq and Coq-IDE, which will remove the IDE dependency
entirely from the core Coq package.  OPAM's dependencies will ensure that
Coq-IDE stays precisely in sync with the version of Coq that's installed.
