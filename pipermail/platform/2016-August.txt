Subject: [ocaml-platform] Consequences from pattern matching in function
	implementations
Message-ID: <2a695bba-a12b-03bf-9fca-0753e9774917@web.de>

Hello,

Does the use of pattern matching influence the execution speed
for OCaml functions with several parameters?
https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variables-and-functions.html#declaring-functions-with-function

Are the run-time characteristics different while using the
construct "match argument with" for a specific parameter instead?

Is another comparison of pattern matching approaches worth
for further considerations?

Regards,
Markus

Subject: [ocaml-platform] Checking a constraint for an OCaml class
Message-ID: <d296b262-1498-2816-29ea-f9eb36d4fd73@web.de>

Hello,

I added a few functions (and methods) to an OCaml class.
Now I wonder about a corresponding constraint "'b = value:'d -> 'e"
which is displayed by the command "ocamlc -i omap2b.ml".

How should I find out if such a generated interface description
is acceptable for my use case?

Regards,
Markus

The ocaml-platform mailing list is dedicated to the development of the
OCaml toolchain (and possibly the relevant aspects of the OCaml
compiler and libraries).
Your question belongs to either caml-list at inria.fr (if you intend a
free-ranging discussion of general interest) or
ocaml_beginners at yahoogroups.com (if you ask for help).
