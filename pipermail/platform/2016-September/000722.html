<PRE> The AGPL license cannot harm OPAM, as, as an owner of opam-builder's code,
OCamlPro is allowed to redistribute opam-builder's code under whatever
licence, including inserting parts of it in OPAM under the current OPAM
license (LGPLv2+EXN). Note also that the patch on OPAM used by opam-builder
is not under AGPL, but already under OPAM's license.

Anyway, I think we should not diverge from the original topics, which is
how we could improve the current opam-builder hosted at OCamlPro to be more
useful for maintainers. I will rebuild an archive of result files
(including lint files this time), so that contributors can easily change
the display without actually running the whole system.

A related topics is the large number of opened issues being discussed on
opam-repository, maybe we could also use references to opam-builder (and
OWS) to close issues that are duplicates of problems already shown on these
websites ? (this together with FAQ items could make it easier to triage
issues as for git-on-windows)

&gt;<i> If one of your point is that it would be nice to move some of the

</I>&gt;<i> could be made available to opam users directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this goes well beyond the form of small improvements I had in
</I>&gt;<i> mind when starting this thread, which are purely about making opam-builder,
</I>&gt;<i> as a service, more useful to the open-source opam community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I now understand the other point, which is that companies with internal
</I>&gt;<i> opam repositories would want to run internal opam-builder instances, and
</I>&gt;<i> that the AGPL license may prevent these internal deployments because of
</I>&gt;<i> internal company policies.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I'm also in general interested in the ability to deploy separate
</I>&gt;<i> opam-builder instances; for instance, I wonder how much work it would be
</I>&gt;<i> for the Coq community, which is starting to use opam, to deploy their own
</I>&gt;<i> opam-builder for their repositories.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; And, in any case, any AGPL-related restriction might arguably prevent

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...and OPAM was explicitly designed to support installation behind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firewalls, which is what we do at work at Docker.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but I see even less how they could prevent you from contributing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patches to the software itself, intended to take effect on Fabrice's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances -- that's the way I've been considering contribution to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opam-builder so far, although others are of course warmly welcome to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own instances if they want.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This isn't very useful for our purposes without access to our internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remotes and code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is quite a comprehensive library driving opam-builder that could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribute to the OPAM tooling ecosystem, but cannot currently be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extricated from the server software itself:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Like Thomas, I'm also unfortunately unable to contribute to software that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is restrictively licensed enough that it is not compatible with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mainline OPAM license of LGPLv2. This is not to say that I do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciate the efforts that go into it, and I hope it continues to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hosted and maintained by OCamlPro.  I hope a clear separation continues to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be maintained between OPAM and OPAM-builder, since code really shouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get mixed up as long as the licenses diverge...
