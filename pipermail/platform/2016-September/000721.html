<PRE>If one of your point is that it would be nice to move some of the
opam-builder logic to become independent pieces of the ecosystem (or
benefit opam directly), then I would agree -- and of course anything moved
into OPAM would need to be made available under OPAM's license, and more
generally stuff distributed as libraries would better not use AGPL. There
was some discussion during the workshop on how much of opam-builder's cool
incremental stuff could be done with opam (in particular opam 2.0), or
could be made available to opam users directly.

That said, this goes well beyond the form of small improvements I had in
mind when starting this thread, which are purely about making opam-builder,
as a service, more useful to the open-source opam community.

(I now understand the other point, which is that companies with internal
opam repositories would want to run internal opam-builder instances, and
that the AGPL license may prevent these internal deployments because of
internal company policies.)

Note that I'm also in general interested in the ability to deploy separate
opam-builder instances; for instance, I wonder how much work it would be
for the Coq community, which is starting to use opam, to deploy their own
opam-builder for their repositories.

</I>&gt;<i> Like Thomas, I'm also unfortunately unable to contribute to software that
