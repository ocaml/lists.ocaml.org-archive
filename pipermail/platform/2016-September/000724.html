<PRE>Maybe it would make sense for some heavy industrial users of OCaml to
devote one engineer part-time (one or two days a week, for example) to the
maintenance of the opam-repository ? There are already people from
different organizations contributing, but mostly on their spare time, so
they cannot really spend a lot of time understanding, for every broken
package, how to fix the problem. Having engineers, officially dedicated to
that task by their organizations, would help a lot. Do you think it would
be possible ? I think that the Haskell community as such an engineer
working full-time at maintaining the stability of one of their repositories
(Hackage ? Stackage ?).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Nowadays I consider it a lost cause when I file an issue on the opam-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; repository.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; I think this is an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; I perfectly understand that from the point of view of repo
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; amount of issues (136 now) doesn't entice them to go through the
</I>&gt;<i> backlog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; to try to fix or close them. However I believe that if we try to
</I>&gt;<i> limit the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; backlog or tag them more appropriately there may be a better chance
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; issues do not simply get ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Going through the least recently updated issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; repository/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-asc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; here are a few things that come to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Kill that `request for package` tag. Being a developer-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; system I don't think the opam repository is the place to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; packaging, people should ask upstream (I don't say this didn't make
</I>&gt;<i> sense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; when opam was a baby).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Kill too open ended questions with the `question` tag.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; 3. Go through the `bug` tag. It seems a lot of old things can be
</I>&gt;<i> closed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Agreed - I was briefly involved with Git-for-Windows. I disliked
</I>&gt;<i> hugely the way the principal maintainer runs that project, but one thing
</I>&gt;<i> which was very impressive was his rapid triage of issues. For standard FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> questions, &quot;we&quot; (i.e. a maintainer) should comment with the appropriate FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> link (number 1 would be advice either to contact upstream or a pointer to
</I>&gt;<i> the packaging instructions; number 2 would either link to the manual or a
</I>&gt;<i> general FAQ to open an issue on the appropriate docs repository; etc.) and
</I>&gt;<i> immediately *close* the issue. It doesn't prevent the poster from
</I>&gt;<i> commenting a little further, but it removes a &quot;pointless&quot; issue from the
</I>&gt;<i> list as quickly as possible. Also, if an issue was woefully lacking in
</I>&gt;<i> required information, the issue was closed, rather than requesting further
</I>&gt;<i> information and leaving it open. The OP can always re-open the issue having
</I>&gt;<i> supplied further details (or start a fresh one).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If your issue survives that process, his next stage was tag it and
</I>&gt;<i> determine who was going to fix it - if it a maintainer volunteers, it's
</I>&gt;<i> assigned; otherwise if you don't agree to fix it, it's closed at once
</I>&gt;<i> (happens with feature requests more than bugs, obviously).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Finally, about once a month, he'd go through old issues and ping them
</I>&gt;<i> for status - and close anything which seemed not to be making progress.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It seems to me that for opam-repository a ruthless model would work
</I>&gt;<i> well! Or, as we can see, you can't see the wood for them trees...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; 4. There seem to be a lot of old install glitches that I'm sure are no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; longer relevant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; 5. There are a few open issues where people say that the problem is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; solved, they should be closed...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; I think we should walk up from the oldest issues and whenever things
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; are unclear tag them with `scheduled for closure` and comment that
</I>&gt;<i> without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; any further feedback in 7 days, the issue will be closed. Also in
</I>&gt;<i> general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; it would be nice to introduce tags to distinguish between repo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; organisation issues like [1] (may be long lived) and end-user repo
</I>&gt;<i> install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; failures like [2] (should be short lived).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Perhaps what is needed is a somewhat tedious day with maintainers in
</I>&gt;<i> the same (virtual) place, so that (brief) discussions can take place
</I>&gt;<i> immediately, to control the backlog?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, I rarely look at the issue tracker and its current state makes
</I>&gt;<i> me quite sad (these two are maybe related). Any help to triage these issues
</I>&gt;<i> would be greatly appreciated. I will make a quick first scan to close the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious ones.
