This isn't very useful for our purposes without access to our internal remotes and code.

There is quite a comprehensive library driving opam-builder that could contribute to the OPAM tooling ecosystem, but cannot currently be extricated from the server software itself: <A HREF="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder/tree/master/libs/copam">https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder/tree/master/libs/copam</A>

Like Thomas, I'm also unfortunately unable to contribute to software that is restrictively licensed enough that it is not compatible with the mainline OPAM license of LGPLv2. This is not to say that I do not appreciate the efforts that go into it, and I hope it continues to be hosted and maintained by OCamlPro.  I hope a clear separation continues to be maintained between OPAM and OPAM-builder, since code really shouldn't get mixed up as long as the licenses diverge...

regards,
Anil
