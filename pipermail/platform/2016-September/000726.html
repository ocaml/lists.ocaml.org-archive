<PRE>&gt;<i> The top 4 out of 6 contributors to opam-repository work at Docker
</I>according to the GitHub states [1], and we spend a significant amount of
time maintaining the general coherence of the repository and responding to
PRs, and working on CI infrastructure for OPAM (depext, ocaml-ci-scripts,
and soon some more pieces).  In the top 20, I see around 10 people
associated with OCaml Labs working on opam-repository.

As I said, there are already a lot of people contributing, but I think it's
a very different job from fixing packages on a daily basis. The task of
such an engineer would not be to work on the infrastructure, or
comment/accept/reject pull-requests, but to fix all broken packages, one
after the other, probably, of course, with some priorities (as Gabriel is
doing on his spare time using opam-builder).

&gt;<i> Did you have a concrete suggestion in your below mail for other
</I>contributors?  In general we should make it easier for power users to
contribute to the OPAM repository, as we will have an increased burden of
support when code signing lands (as it requires a quorum among committers).

I think my suggestion was pretty concrete: if there are companies relying
on the opam-repository for their developments, they could assign one of
their engineers to such a task, and make it official, so that it will
reassure users on the future of the repository, and enable us to coordinate
with these engineers. I had the feeling that such a solution is easier for
many companies, compared to contracting OCamlPro to do such a task (i.e.
using their internal resources is easier than giving money to another
company).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Nowadays I consider it a lost cause when I file an issue on the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; repository.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think this is an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I perfectly understand that from the point of view of repo
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; amount of issues (136 now) doesn't entice them to go through the
</I>&gt;<i> backlog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to try to fix or close them. However I believe that if we try to
</I>&gt;<i> limit the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; backlog or tag them more appropriately there may be a better chance
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; issues do not simply get ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Going through the least recently updated issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; repository/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-asc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; here are a few things that come to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Kill that `request for package` tag. Being a developer-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; system I don't think the opam repository is the place to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; packaging, people should ask upstream (I don't say this didn't make
</I>&gt;<i> sense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; when opam was a baby).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Kill too open ended questions with the `question` tag.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 3. Go through the `bug` tag. It seems a lot of old things can be
</I>&gt;<i> closed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed - I was briefly involved with Git-for-Windows. I disliked
</I>&gt;<i> hugely the way the principal maintainer runs that project, but one thing
</I>&gt;<i> which was very impressive was his rapid triage of issues. For standard FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> questions, &quot;we&quot; (i.e. a maintainer) should comment with the appropriate FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> link (number 1 would be advice either to contact upstream or a pointer to
</I>&gt;<i> the packaging instructions; number 2 would either link to the manual or a
</I>&gt;<i> general FAQ to open an issue on the appropriate docs repository; etc.) and
</I>&gt;<i> immediately *close* the issue. It doesn't prevent the poster from
</I>&gt;<i> commenting a little further, but it removes a &quot;pointless&quot; issue from the
</I>&gt;<i> list as quickly as possible. Also, if an issue was woefully lacking in
</I>&gt;<i> required information, the issue was closed, rather than requesting further
</I>&gt;<i> information and leaving it open. The OP can always re-open the issue having
</I>&gt;<i> supplied further details (or start a fresh one).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If your issue survives that process, his next stage was tag it and
</I>&gt;<i> determine who was going to fix it - if it a maintainer volunteers, it's
</I>&gt;<i> assigned; otherwise if you don't agree to fix it, it's closed at once
</I>&gt;<i> (happens with feature requests more than bugs, obviously).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, about once a month, he'd go through old issues and ping
</I>&gt;<i> them for status - and close anything which seemed not to be making progress.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that for opam-repository a ruthless model would work
</I>&gt;<i> well! Or, as we can see, you can't see the wood for them trees...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 4. There seem to be a lot of old install glitches that I'm sure are
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; longer relevant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 5. There are a few open issues where people say that the problem is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; solved, they should be closed...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think we should walk up from the oldest issues and whenever
</I>&gt;<i> things are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are unclear tag them with `scheduled for closure` and comment that
</I>&gt;<i> without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; any further feedback in 7 days, the issue will be closed. Also in
</I>&gt;<i> general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it would be nice to introduce tags to distinguish between repo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; organisation issues like [1] (may be long lived) and end-user repo
</I>&gt;<i> install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; failures like [2] (should be short lived).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps what is needed is a somewhat tedious day with maintainers in
</I>&gt;<i> the same (virtual) place, so that (brief) discussions can take place
</I>&gt;<i> immediately, to control the backlog?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I agree, I rarely look at the issue tracker and its current state
</I>&gt;<i> makes me quite sad (these two are maybe related). Any help to triage these
</I>&gt;<i> issues would be greatly appreciated. I will make a quick first scan to
</I>&gt;<i> close the obvious ones.
