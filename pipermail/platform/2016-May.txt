Hello,

I have messed up my OPAM system, here is the error:

:testweb $ opam switch reinstall system
Your system compiler has been changed. Do you want to upgrade your
OPAM installation ? [Y/n] y
=-=- Upgrading system
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  ? [WARNING]
base-ocamlbuild.base is not available because it requires OCaml >=
3.10 & < 4.03. Skipping.[WARNING] camlp4.4.02+system is not available
because your system doesn't comply with preinstalled &
      ocaml-version >= "4.02" & ocaml-version < "4.03".

The following dependencies couldn't be met:
  - deriving -> camlp4
Your request can't be satisfied:
  - camlp4 is not available because your system doesn't comply with
ocaml-version >= "4.04".

No solution found, exiting
The former package state can be restored with opam switch import
"/Users/softtimur/.opam/backup/state-20160418124642.export" --switch
system

The entire question is on the stackoverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37256100/make-compatible-ocaml-camlp4-ppx-node-js-of-ocaml-ocamlbuild>.
Could anyone help?

Cheers

Timur
