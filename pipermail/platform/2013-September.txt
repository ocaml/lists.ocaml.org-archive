Mike,

I just wanted to update you on this thread:
http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html

I went back and looked at Travis again due to the pull request feature, and it's now really ideal for all the frontend requirements.  We're finding a happy compromise with doing the basic testing with Travis, and using it to fire off the more sophisticated tests using OCamlot on the backend.  All in all, very smooth stuff, and this is now live for OPAM.

The main difference with the scripts from your blog post is that I built a matrix of PPA packages for all the various versions of OCaml and OPAM, so it's less resource intensive for the Travis folk.

I wonder if it's worth proposing native OCaml/OPAM support within Travis itself, once OPAM 1.1  is released...
