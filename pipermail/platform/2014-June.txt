I have ported the mediawiki dump to Markdown. It'll take some manual clean
up, but before I do that, where do people want the content to go? The
content regards camlp4 and ocamlbuild. Thus, I see the following options:

A) Insert into the Tutorials <http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/> on
ocaml.org.

B) Push the camlp4 docs to the camlp4 wiki
<https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4/wiki> on it's github repo. However, there
is not (yet) a corresponding repo for ocamlbuild, so I don't know where the
ocamlbuild pages would go.

C) Push to the ocaml.org wiki
<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Knowledge-Base> on it's github
repo. This is being used as a staging area for content that could
potentially get published to ocaml.org, but isn't yet.

Please let me know if you have any opinions. Thanks.

There is also minimal information on the compiler, which can probably be
ignored. Also there is a page about the Gallium team, which I believe is
superseded by their members page <http://gallium.inria.fr/members.html>.

You can get an idea of the overall content that is being ported at:

My gut feeling is that the camlp4 and ocamlbuild material is good
enough (in terms of quality and coverage of the topic) to go into the
Tutorials section.  (Solution A above.)  But I understand it may need
significant cleanup to fit, in which case solution C is perhaps easier
to implement and much better than nothing.

Yes, please ignore these.

All the best,

Thanks for doing this!  It would probably be easiest to temporarily put it all on the ocaml.org wiki so we can figure out how to split it out.

While ocamlbuild should go on the tutorials for now, it makes more sense for the camlp4 docs to be hosted alongside the camlp4 repo (and perhaps synched to the ocaml.org tutorials, but making it clear that it's an optional and separate component of the OCaml toolchain).

cheers,
Anil

The camlp4 content is now here:
https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4/wiki

We can later automatically import to ocaml.org too, but for now at least
the new wiki is linked from the current camlp4 page
<http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/camlp4_3.10/>.

The ocamlbuild docs are now here:
http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/ocamlbuild/

The ports may contain some bugs, but I did my best to make sure most
formatting was preserved and that all the links work. There were links to
non-existent pages, which I've left that way to make it clear the pages are
not written yet. Let me know if you find any major errors; there were 90
pages so I didn't check them all.

Does anyone know the status of opam-doc. Are we closer to having nice
documentation easily generated for all of our installed libraries?

Hi Ashish,

I will be rewriting the opam-doc tool over the summer as part of work
towards the OCaml platform. Should hopefully have something usable by
September.

The `bin-doc` parts of the tool (which previously parsed documentation
comments and stored them in ".cmd" files) have already been rewritten as
a compiler patch to parse comments and store them in ".cmt" files as
special attributes (on github as pr #51). Unfortunately this patch did
not get into 4.02 as there were some concern over parts of it. I hope to
address these concerns over the summer as well.

Regards,

Leo

Do note that the 'opam-doc' package in OPAM does work at the moment.

It's just not integrated into the compiler, but it does do enough to
compile up the Core docs at Jane Street or the mirage.github.io docs.
We're unlikely to do any bugfixes to that though, as the effort is
going into the new version that Leo describes below.
