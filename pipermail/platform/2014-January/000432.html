<PRE>Happy new year everyone !

I am putting everything together to release 1.1.1 in the next few days, which should unlock the release of opam-doc and help package opam-in-a-box. I am getting through the last few issues tagged for 1.1.1, postponing what is not either trivial or urgent.

1.1.1 features mostly bug-fixes and UI/doc improvements, but also focuses on improving the API and tools to be a better base for the platform (functions for opam-doc, interface with tools like opamfu and opam-installer). Once this is released, there will be more room to (progressively) merge the stash of deeper changes that I have been working on in the meantime.

Please discuss any requests or blockers for 1.1.1 !
The biggest current issue is probably the upgrade problems with the built-in heuristic, but there isn't much we can do before the release, and the real solution is to have aspcud packaged and working on OSX.

Cheers,
Louis
