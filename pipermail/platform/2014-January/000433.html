Thanks Louis!  The solver issue is my last remaining big concern as well
before getting 1.1.1 out of the door.  It would be very useful to
characterise the reason for the failure to see if a quick workaround is
possible, since so many users are hitting it.  If it's just due to the
growing number of packages, perhaps we can add some more constraints to
the package descriptions help the solver find a solution more easily?

Aside from that, the only other problem I can think of that confused users
was the inconsistent 'packages added or removed' display after an opam
update.  Was that fixed?  I couldn't find the live issue.

When you have an RC let me know, and I'll run it through it's paces on the
various BSDs to make sure that there haven't been any regressions due to
the `which` vs `type` changes.
