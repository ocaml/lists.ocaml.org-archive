Subject: [ocaml-platform] Counting packages that use specific compiler flags.
Message-ID: <CAGmVoG0E5-dVuGoKnezXs40Y00Dv6SPOPPBaDzcWRZskGGr51g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey, folks

I wondering can we measure how many packages in the repository use
some specific compiler flags. More precisely, I'm curious about
`rectypes`. I see the problem about variety  of build systems and I
can't see the easy solution. Do you know the one?

Happy hacking,
Kakadu
