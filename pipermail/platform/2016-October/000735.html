</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the rights are not equal, but often, the contributions are not equal either. I have written 100% of the code of opam-builder, so why shall I give you the same rights on my code, just because you might eventually contribute 10 lines ? Are you the one who will maintain the full code over time, fix bugs in the lines you added, make them evolve, and so on ? You want the same rights, but without the same duties.
</I>

Frankly I don't give a shit about what you do with your code or how you license it. Just notice that the system you setup will precisely *not* entice people to make large contributions or take over these duties.  

&gt;<i> We changed the license in your sense instead of introducing a CLA because you convinced everybody it was needed to increase the number of contributions.
</I>
1) The OPAM license wasn't changed in my sense, the bug of the license was fixed.
2) I never said it would increase the number of contributions. I said that CLAs were barriers to contribution [1].

&gt;<i> Looking at the git logs in github.com/ocaml/opam (<A HREF="http://github.com/ocaml/opam">http://github.com/ocaml/opam</A>), the number of contributions have actually decreased since the license went more liberal...
</I>
The license didn't go more liberal, the license had a bug which was fixed so that it would correspond to the original intent.  

And about that decrease in contributions, my sincere apologies to the community, that is certainly because we didn't introduce a CLA, I'll take the blame for this.
