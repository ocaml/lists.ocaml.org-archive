<PRE>Thanks! I'm glad user-setup is being useful.

About the multiple, conflicting instructions: it may not be up-to-date, but 
there is a tweak in the opam files to make them not display the instructions 
when they detect user-setup has been installed as well.

For example, ocp-index has:

    post-messages: &quot;...instructions...&quot; {success &amp; !user-setup:installed}

I think it was put in merlin's definition as well, but didn't get upstream and 
was lost in the updates.

To complete this, the helper packages should mention in their doc &quot;either 
install opam-user-setup, or follow these manual instructions&quot;. If they find 
any limitations in user-setup, I invite the maintainers of these packages to 
contribute!

Put together, these two should be enough to ease the confusion ?

Thanks for the feedback!

PS: another option that was mentionned in the past was to provide a &quot;starter-
kit&quot; metapackage that would install all these tools with a simpler command.
