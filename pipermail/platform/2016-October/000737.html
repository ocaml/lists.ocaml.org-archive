<PRE>I'll second this. All of us in this conversation have done a huge amount of work towards advancing the state of OCaml, and care deeply about the future of OPAM and its ecosystem. It is my hope that there is room for everyone to grow and flourish their particular visions of OPAM tooling, and discourse such as this licensing thread is important to establish a common understanding for everyone to work together under an open-source umbrella.

However, there is absolutely no room for disrespectful discourse in this community. Let's lay our arguments out rationally, and attempt to reach a consensus.  It's normal for complex issues such as CLAs and licenses to take some time to work through, and also for there to be stepping stones where we do not all agree on the right solutions.

I would like to curate this list as a place where such matters can be discussed and understood, so we are all aware of each other's efforts towards our ultimate goal of an awesome OCaml developer experience.

regards,
Anil

</I>&gt;<i> I understand that people care deeply about these issues, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't address them in a calm and respectful way. Discussing these issues is hard enough without mixing harsh language into the debate.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; While not granting the same rights to the contributor if you don't have a liberal (in the sense non GPL) license... What you say is a gross misrepresentation of the actual implications of the terms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, the rights are not equal, but often, the contributions are not equal either. I have written 100% of the code of opam-builder, so why shall I give you the same rights on my code, just because you might eventually contribute 10 lines ? Are you the one who will maintain the full code over time, fix bugs in the lines you added, make them evolve, and so on ? You want the same rights, but without the same duties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Frankly I don't give a shit about what you do with your code or how you license it. Just notice that the system you setup will precisely *not* entice people to make large contributions or take over these duties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We changed the license in your sense instead of introducing a CLA because you convinced everybody it was needed to increase the number of contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The OPAM license wasn't changed in my sense, the bug of the license was fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I never said it would increase the number of contributions. I said that CLAs were barriers to contribution [1].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looking at the git logs in github.com/ocaml/opam (<A HREF="http://github.com/ocaml/opam">http://github.com/ocaml/opam</A>), the number of contributions have actually decreased since the license went more liberal...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The license didn't go more liberal, the license had a bug which was fixed so that it would correspond to the original intent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And about that decrease in contributions, my sincere apologies to the community, that is certainly because we didn't introduce a CLA, I'll take the blame for this.
