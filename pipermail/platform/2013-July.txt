Subject: [ocaml-platform] Pcap-related packages in OPAM
Message-ID: <CAKS5mhSC=OzkcftBuApQqn0PsaqC1KtY5S78_UA3h06b1UDM3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
There currently is an OPAM package called pcap based on ocaml-pcap (
https://github.com/djs55/ocaml-pcap).
However, the OCaml binbings to libpcap have the same name: pcap. These
bindings are still relevant because they provides bindings to live capture
on network interface.

Would it be possible to change the current OPAM package to something else
like cstruct-pcap ? It would allow one to install both packages in OPAM.
Regards.

Hi,

Is there a pattern we should apply more generally? I know of two other
packages which both implement functions to read/write .vhd format disk
files. One is a binding to a C lib "vhd" and the other is a pure ocaml
implementation of the spec. They have disjoint feature sets, so both are
useful. Initially both were just called "vhd" in opam. Since then the C
binding one was renamed "libvhd" IIRC.

I'm happy to rename the ocaml-pcap to whatever makes the most sense.

Cheers,
Dave

Hi Johan, David,

The existing OPAM policy is simply to package by consensus.  If you could
both agree on suitable and unique names and submit a pull request or issue
to http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository, we will merge the changes
into the stable repository.

The same issue has come up with a couple of other packages (such as
openflow, or vhd as David points out).  It would be good to distinguish
them with a prefix less generic than "ocaml-" if possible.  For example,
if Dave's pcap bindings are just the format and not the library, it might
be appropriate to call it pcap-format.

best,
Anil

In Debian we have a loose 'naming' policy for that:
http://pkg-ocaml-maint.alioth.debian.org/ocaml_packaging_policy.html/c305.html

Most of the time, we decide to consider that a library ocaml-blah
provides blah if the findlib name is blah. In this case we name the
package libblah-ocaml-dev.

Basically we are considering that findlib names are unique and we map
to them. As a matter of fact this make sense and if you have a naming
problem it probably means that you cannot install both library at the
same time ! (because findlib will be confused if two different
libraries have the same name).

Althought these are guidelines and not really enforced.

Actually, I just sent this email to expose the problem.
I do not have a very good understanding of naming policies and so on. So, I
think I am way under-qualified to propose a solution.

Hi,

OK, I think the convention that a library which understands the format
"foo" is called "foo-format" is fine. Thanks for the reminder about the
ocamlfind package name too. I've updated two packages (and ocamlfind names):

  pcap-format
  vhd-format

(Note there still may be a clash between the module names defined in these
ocamlfind packages and other similar ones making it hard to compile them
into the same program -- I guess namespaces will help with this eventually)

The pcap-format package update pull request is pending review[1] while the
vhd-format package has already been merged into OCamlPro/opam-repository on
github.

Cheers,
Dave

Subject: [ocaml-platform] glMLite and Png_loader
Message-ID: <CANZsUA9vmGwpY40xPcvQqkQtRGnoqx6aEm7qu-U58=Gk_Oe4Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm using the excellent glMLite package through OPAM. A minor inconvenience
is that the Png_loader module isn't compiled and installed during a typical
"make", but only when "make install_png" is invoked. (It seems to me that
the PNG loader should always be installed, if the supporting library is
available.)

Should I send a request to the package maintainer? Or is this something
that can be addressed at the OPAM level? For example, can I specify a
Makefile target somehow during "opam install"?

Many thanks,
Graham
