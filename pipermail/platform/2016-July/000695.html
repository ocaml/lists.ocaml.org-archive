Testing only the latest version of each package would already be very 
useful.  As a matter of fact, it could even detect earlier some problems 
by restricting the universe only to latest version of all packages (see 
below).

Moreover, it could be interesting to define a subset of &quot;strategic&quot; 
packages that we should really be up-to-date on OCaml release dates. 
Wasn't it part of the &quot;platform&quot; project to define such a curated list 
of packages?

Do you have a description of OPAM-builder current strategy?  I found out 
yesterday that a simple &quot;opam install ppx_type_conv&quot; would fail on a 
clean 4.03 switch, because the latest version of that package compatible 
with 4.03 depends on ppx_deriving with no upper bound constraint, and 
OPAM chooses to install the latest version of ppx_deriving which turns 
out to be incompatible with that version of ppx_type_conv.  But 
OPAM-builder did not report any error for that version of ppx_type_conv: 
it picked an older version of ppx_deriving (which works fine).  I'm 
wondering if this is because of a different solver configuration, or a 
deliberate (or not) consequence of OPAM-builder strategy.
