Actually, one of my plans when creating opam-builder was to output a list
of versions that would be compatible for a small set of packages (the
platform), and create an opam-repository with only them, i.e. it would be
the equivalent of Debian stable while the standard repository would be
Debian unstable. Clearly, we currently under-use the information that is
available in opam-builder.

</I>&gt;<i>

About that part of the discussion, I am really against any additional
constraint that would delay a release of OCaml. We waited for years before
deciding to have a regular release schedule (every 6 months), and now,
everybody tries to delay releases for various reasons. So, yes to more
monitoring of the compatibility of platform packages with trunk and
beta-releases, but no to delaying the release because of platform packages
being late to meet compatibility.


&gt;<i> Do you have a description of OPAM-builder current strategy?
</I>

Everything is on Github:
Opam-Builder: <A HREF="http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder">http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder</A>
OPAM fork: <A HREF="https://github.com/lefessan/opam/tree/2016-03-02-opam-builder">https://github.com/lefessan/opam/tree/2016-03-02-opam-builder</A>

For the strategy, it is the same as OPAM's standard strategy, i.e. it tries
to match your query while minimizing the number of installed packages.
That's the reason why it prefers `ppx_deriving.3.3` to `ppx_deriving.4.0`
(that have an additional requirement to `result`). As a side note, as there
are more and more meta packages (i.e. whose build/installation cost is
null), we should clearly change that strategy to (1) add an installation
cost in every package (`1` by default, `0` for meta-packages) and (2) try
to minimize installation cost instead of number of packages.
