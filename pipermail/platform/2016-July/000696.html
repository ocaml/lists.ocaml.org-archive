I forgot to say that, actually, the multi-core arch is only used for
parallel compilation of multiple OCaml versions (i.e. each switch is
compiled in parallel with other switches), but within a switch, parallel
build of packages is disabled, because we cache modifications to the
installation (even with the new version of OPAM, that builds in parallel
and install sequentially, we don't have the guarrantee that an incorrect
package will not modify the installation during its build, i.e. for example
`coq` that creates a symlink in $bindir during its build...).

I might have over-estimated the time it takes to rebuild completely a
switch, I think it is lower with 4.03.0, because many packages are not
available for it, and probably the same for trunk. It might actually
already be under one day.
