I'm told that that is how Debian thought they could organise things.  
But they discovered that they also needed a  testing repository.  I'm 
not sure why, but I think it had to do with unstabe being, well, too 
unstable.  Packages mgrated from unstable to testing after a week with 
no serious bugs appearing aginst them, but nly after their dependencies 
had also migrated.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Moreover, it could be interesting to define a subset of &quot;strategic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packages that we should really be up-to-date on OCaml release dates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wasn't it part of the &quot;platform&quot; project to define such a curated list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of packages?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About that part of the discussion, I am really against any additional
</I>&gt;<i> constraint that would delay a release of OCaml. We waited for years before
</I>&gt;<i> deciding to have a regular release schedule (every 6 months), and now,
</I>&gt;<i> everybody tries to delay releases for various reasons. So, yes to more
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring of the compatibility of platform packages with trunk and
</I>&gt;<i> beta-releases, but no to delaying the release because of platform packages
</I>&gt;<i> being late to meet compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have a description of OPAM-builder current strategy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everything is on Github:
</I>&gt;<i> Opam-Builder: <A HREF="http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder">http://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-builder</A>
</I>&gt;<i> OPAM fork: <A HREF="https://github.com/lefessan/opam/tree/2016-03-02-opam-builder">https://github.com/lefessan/opam/tree/2016-03-02-opam-builder</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the strategy, it is the same as OPAM's standard strategy, i.e. it tries
</I>&gt;<i> to match your query while minimizing the number of installed packages.
</I>&gt;<i> That's the reason why it prefers `ppx_deriving.3.3` to `ppx_deriving.4.0`
</I>&gt;<i> (that have an additional requirement to `result`). As a side note, as there
</I>&gt;<i> are more and more meta packages (i.e. whose build/installation cost is
</I>&gt;<i> null), we should clearly change that strategy to (1) add an installation
</I>&gt;<i> cost in every package (`1` by default, `0` for meta-packages) and (2) try
</I>&gt;<i> to minimize installation cost instead of number of packages.
