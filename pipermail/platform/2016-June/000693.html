<PRE>Fabrice: indeed.

I thought of proposing a process for using opam-builder against trunk (eg.
swipe the state every two weeks and update the compiler used to the HEAD of
trunk at this moment only; the incremental capabilities are still useful to
monitor the effect of proposed fixes in opam packages), but I think that
for trunk fixing there are more delicate questions that arise (than at the
beta stage). For example, deciding when the trunk state is &quot;good&quot; for
testing, and deciding what to do with breakage report, as reporting them to
maintainers &quot;too soon&quot; is not always the right choice -- we may want to
revert the change in trunk instead, or improve its compatibility status.

I have a clear, simple proposal for the end of the release process: remain
in beta stage as long as there are OPAM packages that are considered
installable but fail to build with the beta. (Provided we have tools to
automate the addition of ocaml version bounds, the release manager would
have the avaibility to declare it done and simply mark all remaining
packages un-installable whenever they want to get the release out.)

As a first step, I would get all installable OPAM packages to build on
4.03.0, and I will try to push fixes and bounds, and motivate people to
participate to that effect in the following weeks, using the opam-builder
reports.

I'm interested in working to get more software to build on trunk, but I
don't have a clear proposal or process in mind yet, so I won't make any
specific proposal for now.

P.S.: I'm a bit worried by the &quot;uses a fork of OPAM&quot; part of opam-builder,
isn't there a risk of increased divergence over time and eventual
unusability? Could we integrate the salient features in opam proper?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's clarify that I am not trying to blame maintainers of packages for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the issues that I highlighted. I believe that we are all doing our best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given the current processes and expectations, and I would like to fix the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process to improve the results. (In particular, I think that the beta
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> period for 4.03 was insufficient for maintainers to update their packages.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yotam: I don't think a clear separation of responsibility (package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors vs. &quot;the entire community&quot;) is possible. The free software that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> powers the OCaml ecosystem should be maintained collectively at all times.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is particularly true in the context of adapting to a new OCaml version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that changed some things; it is often the case that the package authors are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not the most qualified to understand the required changes -- they know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their codebase well, but don't necessarily follow OCaml evolutions closely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Early-adopters and enthusiasts, such as you and I, have a large role to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> play in helping the ecosystem evolve gracefully by sending patches to fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bugs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fabrice: again, it's not about who maintains the software (and I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that the ocaml/ umbrella automatically guarantees more maintenance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> External contributors can easily fix software to work on trunk or new OCaml
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions -- I've done it for atdgen and Coqide and it was not much work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fabrice: Indeed, I think that opam-builder is a great tool to put at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forefront of such an effort. The current version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://opam.ocamlpro.com/builder/html/report-last.html">http://opam.ocamlpro.com/builder/html/report-last.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitors the state of the OPAM repository for released OCaml versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everything that is orange (except maybe for the &quot;lint&quot; column) is a bug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we must collectively fix.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will try to experiment more with opam-builder (understand its error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explanations better and try to fix a part of it to see what the experiment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is) before suggesting any specific process.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've also been bitten by this issue with 4.03. Specifically, Merlin
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> took about 2 weeks post-release to be ready, making it much harder to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> program in 4.03, and I had a dependency chain that needed OASIS to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> build.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think we can avoid having a specialized pre-release period for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> getting the packages up and running. I noticed many of these breakages
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before 4.03 was released, but package authors aren't responsive to a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pre-release breakage.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's important to prioritize though -- those packages that have the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most reverse-dependencies and the ones that are most popular, should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be the highest priorities to fix. OPAM has this info, and just as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-popularity.html">https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-popularity.html</A> page shows the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most popular packages, I think it should pull their build-state for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the latest OCAML release version and highlight them if they're broken.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Speaking of which, it would be nice if the opam webpage also had a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'sort by reverse dependencies' list.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One schedule that perhaps could work would be to have a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pre-platform-release month. Within this month, package authors would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have the first 2 weeks to fix their packages. After these 2 weeks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there would be a rallying cry to fix packages sorted by priority
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (highest reverse-dependencies &amp; highest popularity), and the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> community would be mobilized to help in the effort. Once a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;sufficient&quot; number of the highest priority packages are fixed, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> full release can take place, but the work can be ongoing.
