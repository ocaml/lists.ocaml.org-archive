<PRE>TL;DR:
1. We need to have a &quot;test:&quot; field in OPAM metadata and get packages to use
it.
2. We should do a weekly build of OPAM using the ocaml *trunk* version, to
help find and fix (with the cooperation of compiler developers upstream)
issues before the actual release.
3. If such a weekly build is effective, the policy of &quot;stay in beta as long
as allegedly-installable OPAM packages fail to build on the new release&quot;
would be much easier to accept. We could target *all* opam-repository
packages instead of any subset, and it could take less than a month -- say
two weeks.
4. It would be nice to have an automated tool to add a given version bound
on a set of opam files. (And that is easy to implement.)

&gt;<i> As usual, the issue is: what set of packages is monitored, and who

</I>

In this case there is a canonical answer: all of them (on the
public/central OPAM repository).

Note that OWS only tests installability from metadata, which is a useful
metric, but doesn't help when the metadata is wrong and build actually
fails. Damien has a script to compile all of OPAM that could give
buildability result.

Which gets us to the next point: we really should use a &quot;test:&quot; field in
opam metadata and use that. In the atdgen case for example, the software
would compile fine, but it would segfault at usage -- already in the
testsuite. I think that introducing such a &quot;test:&quot; field should be among
our priorities to improve the quality of the OPAM repository.

I agree with the workflow you propose, as long as the beta-testing period
is long enough -- I suggested &quot;one month&quot; and I think it's a good proposal.
Because we could do this with the one-week-long beta period we had in 4.03,
and it would amount to just adding an upper bound on all software, and that
would better for users but only marginally so -- they don't get a crippled
opam-repository, they get a crippled release with no installable software.

In fact I think we should go further and try to make all of OPAM work with
trunk OCaml versions. We could have a weekly build of all-opam from trunk
and collectively fix the issues. This would help ocaml-trunk development
(being able to compile software to test trunk changes is one pain point
right now), and this would help have working software by the release time
-- maybe we wouldn't even need such a long beta period if we did this
effectively.

I don't add upper bounds myself on my own packages (too tedious to do it on
&gt;<i> 15 old releases), so it should probably be automated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree; this should be very easy to do using existing opam scripting
capabilities. Any volunteers?

I don't buy it. I think the rate of OCaml change is accelerating rather
than slowing down. Think of what will happen if we merge some form of
multicore-ocaml in the future; all FFI code will break loose (well maybe
not all, but like Obj.magic in 4.03, enough will).

</I>
I agree. I think that staring testing packages using trunk rather than
waiting for the release could help with that. First, if the breakage is
under the eyes of the upstream OCaml devs, it may be easier for them to
understand the cause and find the fix -- in my experience helping people
un-break software after a new OCaml version, having a deep knowledge of
said software was rarely necessary, and understanding the compiler was more
useful. Plus it may also encourage people to revert or tame changes that
break user software, reducing the number of changes required of package
maintainers.

</I>&gt;<i> I have the chance to be most of the time a passive user of OCaml, i.e. we

</I>&gt;<i> labeling an OCaml/opam distribution as beta, but finer-grained. Each

</I>&gt;<i> package could be in one of a few states such as: OK, Usable but has some

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I started writing this email I intended to send it to Damien

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following suggestion: maybe we could have a *much longer* beta-testing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> period for OCaml versions that would be used not (only) for finding bugs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the new version, but also to let important pieces of the ecosystem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> update to the new version. Say, at least a month. We could have a fixed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set of software that we monitor, or in fact all of what's in OPAM, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delay the release until they get updated/fixed or their OPAM version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bounds get fixed. (Aha, a Platform indeed!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does that sound like a reasonable idea to you? Should we monitor all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OPAM, or only a subset?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This suggestion is rooted in the idea that when we announce the release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to our end-users, stuff should just work -- or refuse to install itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe this is an old idea of the SVN times and we're now in the era of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuously-released, always-broken stuff?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, there has been all this work on the &quot;OPAM weather services&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuous build of opam packages etc., plus the work that Damien is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing around release time. It doesn't seem to have worked very well for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.03. Who is monitoring this stuff? Do we need to fix them to make them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work better, or to fix our process to use them better? To be honest, I'm
