<PRE>Le mer. 29 juin 2016 &#224; 19:14, Simon Cruanes &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">simon.cruanes.2007 at m4x.org</A>&gt; a
&#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Le Wed, 29 Jun 2016, Gabriel Scherer a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a bit frustrated with the time it takes for the OCaml ecosystem to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; catch up with the 4.03 release -- which has been released two months ago
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now, on April 25.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you agree that this is a problem? What could we do to fix that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, I wanted to update my packages after the release and had to
</I>&gt;<i> wait for oasis to work on 4.03; some other dependencies of projects of
</I>&gt;<i> mine also took some time. Even now, I just stumbled upon Coq 8.5 not
</I>&gt;<i> compiling, so I'd say the problem is real.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Just to be fair to the OASIS release cycle:
- OCaml 4.03 was released 2016-04-26
- OASIS 0.4.6 for OCaml 4.03 was released 2016-04-29

This is only 3 days and this was mainly due to a transitive dependency on
Batteries for the tests. Considering OSS standards, this is not a long time
for a fix.


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I started writing this email I intended to send it to Damien
</I>&gt;<i> Doligez,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the release manager of the compiler distribution, with the following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggestion: maybe we could have a *much longer* beta-testing period for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OCaml versions that would be used not (only) for finding bugs in the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version, but also to let important pieces of the ecosystem update to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new version. Say, at least a month. We could have a fixed set of software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we monitor, or in fact all of what's in OPAM, and delay the release
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until they get updated/fixed or their OPAM version bounds get fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> (Aha,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a Platform indeed!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As usual, the issue is: what set of packages is monitored, and who
</I>&gt;<i> chooses?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that sound like a reasonable idea to you? Should we monitor all
</I>&gt;<i> OPAM,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or only a subset?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think OWS should be used to see which packages are broken on the new
</I>&gt;<i> release, indeed. I would propose the following workflow:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the beta-testing period, feature-frozen, starts (for some time)
</I>&gt;<i> - shortly, maintainers whose package doesn't compile (we know thanks to
</I>&gt;<i>   OWS) are emailed to be informed of the problem
</I>&gt;<i> - if, at the end of the beta-testing period (just before the release) a
</I>&gt;<i>   package that used to build on the previous release, but does not build
</I>&gt;<i>   anymore, is modified by opam-repo maintainers so it gets an upper
</I>&gt;<i>   bound on the OCaml version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that, if no action is taken, a
</I>&gt;<i> package that does not build on 4.04 would have &quot;ocaml-version &lt; 4.04&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> New releases of this package, that hopefully fix the build on 4.04,
</I>&gt;<i> would lift this barrier. It would also prevent opam from falling back
</I>&gt;<i> to old, incompatible versions of a package in case of conflict with
</I>&gt;<i> some other library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New packages are checked for build on most versions of OCaml; I think
</I>&gt;<i> old packages should also be checked for compatibility with newer
</I>&gt;<i> versions of OCaml so that the appropriate bound check is added. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> add those bounds myself on my own packages (too tedious to do it on 15
</I>&gt;<i> old releases), so it should probably be automated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
