You can ask this kind of diligence from sub-contractors, not from
open-source contributors, especially when a package is maintained only by
one developer on his/her sparetime. Or if you think these components are
key to the infrastructure, why not move their development to
github.com/ocaml/ with a larger team of maintainers, as it was done for
OPAM ?
