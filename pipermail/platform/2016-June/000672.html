<PRE>Le Wed, 29 Jun 2016, Gabriel Scherer a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I'm a bit frustrated with the time it takes for the OCaml ecosystem to
</I>&gt;<i> catch up with the 4.03 release -- which has been released two months ago
</I>&gt;<i> now, on April 25.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you agree that this is a problem? What could we do to fix that?
</I>
I agree, I wanted to update my packages after the release and had to
wait for oasis to work on 4.03; some other dependencies of projects of
mine also took some time. Even now, I just stumbled upon Coq 8.5 not
compiling, so I'd say the problem is real.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I started writing this email I intended to send it to Damien Doligez,
</I>&gt;<i> as the release manager of the compiler distribution, with the following
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion: maybe we could have a *much longer* beta-testing period for
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml versions that would be used not (only) for finding bugs in the new
</I>&gt;<i> version, but also to let important pieces of the ecosystem update to the
</I>&gt;<i> new version. Say, at least a month. We could have a fixed set of software
</I>&gt;<i> that we monitor, or in fact all of what's in OPAM, and delay the release
</I>&gt;<i> until they get updated/fixed or their OPAM version bounds get fixed. (Aha,
</I>&gt;<i> a Platform indeed!)
</I>
As usual, the issue is: what set of packages is monitored, and who
chooses?

&gt;<i> Does that sound like a reasonable idea to you? Should we monitor all OPAM,
</I>&gt;<i> or only a subset?
</I>
I think OWS should be used to see which packages are broken on the new
release, indeed. I would propose the following workflow:

- the beta-testing period, feature-frozen, starts (for some time)
- shortly, maintainers whose package doesn't compile (we know thanks to
  OWS) are emailed to be informed of the problem
- if, at the end of the beta-testing period (just before the release) a
  package that used to build on the previous release, but does not build
  anymore, is modified by opam-repo maintainers so it gets an upper
  bound on the OCaml version.

This means that, if no action is taken, a
package that does not build on 4.04 would have &quot;ocaml-version &lt; 4.04&quot;.
New releases of this package, that hopefully fix the build on 4.04,
would lift this barrier. It would also prevent opam from falling back
to old, incompatible versions of a package in case of conflict with
some other library.

New packages are checked for build on most versions of OCaml; I think
old packages should also be checked for compatibility with newer
versions of OCaml so that the appropriate bound check is added. I don't
add those bounds myself on my own packages (too tedious to do it on 15
old releases), so it should probably be automated.

Cheers!
