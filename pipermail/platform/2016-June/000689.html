<PRE>I've also been bitten by this issue with 4.03. Specifically, Merlin
took about 2 weeks post-release to be ready, making it much harder to
program in 4.03, and I had a dependency chain that needed OASIS to
build.

I don't think we can avoid having a specialized pre-release period for
getting the packages up and running. I noticed many of these breakages
before 4.03 was released, but package authors aren't responsive to a
pre-release breakage.

It's important to prioritize though -- those packages that have the
most reverse-dependencies and the ones that are most popular, should
be the highest priorities to fix. OPAM has this info, and just as the
<A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-popularity.html">https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/index-popularity.html</A> page shows the
most popular packages, I think it should pull their build-state for
the latest OCAML release version and highlight them if they're broken.
Speaking of which, it would be nice if the opam webpage also had a
'sort by reverse dependencies' list.

One schedule that perhaps could work would be to have a
pre-platform-release month. Within this month, package authors would
have the first 2 weeks to fix their packages. After these 2 weeks,
there would be a rallying cry to fix packages sorted by priority
(highest reverse-dependencies &amp; highest popularity), and the entire
community would be mobilized to help in the effort. Once a
&quot;sufficient&quot; number of the highest priority packages are fixed, the
full release can take place, but the work can be ongoing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or if you think these components are key to the infrastructure, why not move their development to github.com/ocaml/ (<A HREF="http://github.com/ocaml/">http://github.com/ocaml/</A>) with a larger team of maintainers, as it was done for OPAM ?

</I>&gt;<i> I personally don't care as I'm not interested in oasis. But many other programmer seem to use it so it's a pre-requesite for them to be able to work in a given release and if this doesn't happen during the betas then we get less testing. Regarding oasis' development model I'll let users of oasis decide on what is best them.
