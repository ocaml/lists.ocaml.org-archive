<PRE>Let's clarify that I am not trying to blame maintainers of packages for the
issues that I highlighted. I believe that we are all doing our best given
the current processes and expectations, and I would like to fix the process
to improve the results. (In particular, I think that the beta period for
4.03 was insufficient for maintainers to update their packages.)

Yotam: I don't think a clear separation of responsibility (package authors
vs. &quot;the entire community&quot;) is possible. The free software that powers the
OCaml ecosystem should be maintained collectively at all times. It is
particularly true in the context of adapting to a new OCaml version that
changed some things; it is often the case that the package authors are not
the most qualified to understand the required changes -- they know their
codebase well, but don't necessarily follow OCaml evolutions closely.
Early-adopters and enthusiasts, such as you and I, have a large role to
play in helping the ecosystem evolve gracefully by sending patches to fix
the bugs.

Fabrice: again, it's not about who maintains the software (and I don't
think that the ocaml/ umbrella automatically guarantees more maintenance).
External contributors can easily fix software to work on trunk or new OCaml
versions -- I've done it for atdgen and Coqide and it was not much work.

Fabrice: Indeed, I think that opam-builder is a great tool to put at the
forefront of such an effort. The current version

  <A HREF="http://opam.ocamlpro.com/builder/html/report-last.html">http://opam.ocamlpro.com/builder/html/report-last.html</A>

monitors the state of the OPAM repository for released OCaml versions.
Everything that is orange (except maybe for the &quot;lint&quot; column) is a bug
that we must collectively fix.

I will try to experiment more with opam-builder (understand its error
explanations better and try to fix a part of it to see what the experiment
is) before suggesting any specific process.

</I>&gt;<i> the latest OCAML release version and highlight them if they're broken.
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, it would be nice if the opam webpage also had a
</I>&gt;<i> 'sort by reverse dependencies' list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One schedule that perhaps could work would be to have a
</I>&gt;<i> pre-platform-release month. Within this month, package authors would
</I>&gt;<i> have the first 2 weeks to fix their packages. After these 2 weeks,
</I>&gt;<i> there would be a rallying cry to fix packages sorted by priority
</I>&gt;<i> (highest reverse-dependencies &amp; highest popularity), and the entire
</I>&gt;<i> community would be mobilized to help in the effort. Once a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sufficient&quot; number of the highest priority packages are fixed, the
</I>&gt;<i> full release can take place, but the work can be ongoing.
