<PRE>Le mercredi, 29 juin 2016 &#224; 21:30, Gabriel Scherer a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> If specific software is found to be too fragile/unreliable to resist to OCaml version changes (this arguably is the case of Batteries by design as its testsuite breaks when the stdlib is extended and Batteries isn't to match it up), we can decide to always add pessimistic upper bounds on its packaged versions (Batteries, camlp5 do that).  
</I>
This should not be done as it makes it needlessly difficult for compiler and runtime system developers/researchers to test their experimental changes on large real-world subsets of the ocaml repo. (This is also the reason why I'm pushing to have actually working byte-code only switches).  

Daniel
