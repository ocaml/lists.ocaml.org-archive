Great proposal! I just have some minor comments:

- it would help to explain somewhere (and if possible early in the document) what does it mean to sign a file, i.e. adding a field "signature". The "Signed files and tags" explain part of the process, but without explicitly saying anything.

- also it was not totally clear to me at first read that the Linearity condition is a kind of "custom policy checking", where the custom policy is actually quite different of what the default TUF specification. i.e., the snapshot bot should know and apply a policy set by the repository maintainers (which can change over time).

Let me know if you need something special in ocaml-git (such as more support for annotated tags) to implement the proposal.

Best,
Thomas
