We now also have a GitHub mirror of the OCaml manual:

    https://github.com/ocaml/ocamldoc/

Could we please extend the experiment to include pull requests to the
manual as well as to the main source tree?  There have been a few pull
requests recently that will need corresponding updates to the
documentation.  It'd be useful to give source and documentation
changes the same visibility.

Sure, let's consider this repository is also part of the PR experiment.

Jacques-Pascal: that's a good remark, but to be fair the names comes
from the original SVN repository for the ocaml manual, itself named
"ocamldoc". I agree "ocaml-manual" would be a better name.

I've renamed it to ocaml-manual.  GitHub maintains a redirection, so the
scripts can continue to push to the old name.

Subject: [ocaml-platform] Cooperation of OPAM with build system generators?
Message-ID: <53493C7C.9040301@web.de>

Hello,

I would like to create a few software packages for a library in the format that
is supported by the tool "OCaml Package Manager".

The developer manual contains a bit of information for build possibilities. I am
missing a few details to make the cooperation of OPAM with a build system
generator like CMake safer. Is a specific selection of a build configuration
needed for such an use case?
How can the software generation tool be different from the command "make" here?

Regards,
Markus

Dear all,

I have gmp living in /opt/local/include and /opt/local/lib, and it
works. However, opam doesn't recognize it, and so I cannot install
why3, without which frama-c is quite impoverished. How do I pass the
location of other directories to search for prerequisites?

Thank you for your assistance.

There is no proper way of handling external installations -- except for the system compiler itself -- at the moment. However, packages installation scripts don't usually rely on OPAM to find their dependencies, so it would probably work if you could set the proper path / library path variables.

Remains the issue that OPAM won't let you install because of a missing dependency. You can use the following workaround to make OPAM believe a package is installed:
```
opam pin gmp 4.4.3      # make sure OPAM won't try to upgrade the package on later upgrades
opam install gmp --fake # pretend to install it, but don't actually run the build instructions
```

Note that `--fake` is not a recommended feature, it was mainly designed for quicker testing. Yet, this is sometimes a useful hack. Should it make its way into the FAQ ?

Cheers,
Louis Gesbert

Message-ID: <534CEBD1.1090200@web.de>

Hello,

The software package format that is supported by the tool "OCaml Package Manager
1.1" refers also to a specific build command. Will it be needed to distinguish
the dependencies for this command from the other build requirements for a software?

Other popular package formats use the following fields to express such information.
- Build-Depends
  http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-sourcebinarydeps

- BuildRequires
  http://rpm5.org/docs/api/dependencies.html

There is discussion about allowing build-time only dependencies, but at the moment everything is under the 'depends' field. This makes sense as OPAM is source-based: the main benefit of build-time only dependencies would be to sometines reduce the amount of recompilations needed.

I am interested in such improvements.

I would generally prefer to distinguish a bit more between "build-time
requirements" and dependencies from the involved build tools.

It may change a little bit from what we have on trunk now, but should be included in 1.2.0

[ I'm probably sending this message to the wrong mailing-lists, so

Hello,

There used to be a Wiki at Inria, http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php,
containing among other things bits and pieces of OCaml documentation,
esp. on ocamlbuild and camlp4.  See for example
https://web.archive.org/web/20131126191244/http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild

It's never been particularly well maintained nor organized.  Recently,
this Wiki was attacked and heavily spammed, so it had to be turned off.

What would be a good place to host this information again?  Is there
interest?  I have a dump of the relevant pages (as Mediawiki markup
embedded in some kind of XML container), and *might* be able to
produce a full Mediawiki dump (despite the abuse done by the
spammers).

Any suggestion welcome!

- Xavier

Hello,

I do use the information about OCamlbuild from time to time. I actually
filled a good chunk of it myself. Some people argued that this kind of
stuff should be part of the manual on caml.inria.fr, but some editing
would be needed.

Cheers,

The bits about ocamlbuild are still useful to me now and then since ocamlbuild documentation is really lacking. I don't really care if it's no longer editable but it would be good to keep it around somewhere.


For camlp4 we could simply put them in the camlp4 github wiki. A github wiki is just a git repo with one markdown file per page so depending on what you really have (is it one xml file per page ?) and if we don't care about history this *may* be not too involved (e.g. pandoc knows how to translate mediawiki to markdown).

Best,

Daniel

Having the Mediawiki dump would definitely be useful -- pandoc does wonders here, as Daniel points out.  Putting it in the GitHub wiki may even encourage people to improve the ocamlbuild documentation (!).

Xavier, if you want to provide the dump (in any format), I'm happy to push
it to some appropriate places, such as the camlp4 GitHub wiki and possibly
the ocaml.org repo.

We'll need permission of the authors, so hopefully we can at least have a
list of their names.

Here is the dump:
http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/tmp/backup-mediawiki-gallium.xml.gz

It starts with a zillion administrative Mediawiki pages, but the good
stuff is at the end.  The XML doesn't look too scary

Yes, the XML dump includes user names for each page.  I could identify
the following names:

        <username>Bardou</username>     Romain Bardou
        <username>Berke</username>      Berke Durak
        <username>Brunodefraine</username> Bruno de Fraine
        <username>Danweil</username>    Daniel Weil
        <username>Dbuenzli</username>   Daniel Buenzli
        <username>Guesdon</username>    Maxence Guesdon
        <username>Mjambon</username>    Martin Jambon
        <username>Naxu</username>       Na (Dana) Xu
        <username>Pilki</username>      Alexandre Pilkiewicz
        <username>Pouillar</username>   Nicolas Pouillard
        <username>Tews</username>       Hendrik Tews
        <username>Xclerc</username>     Xavier Clerc

Thanks a lot for your help!
