</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Following the thread on <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">Teaching at lists.ocaml.org</A> about the needs for teachers and the discussion on opam-in-a-box, here is a preliminary specification of what I intend to do to improve the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * keep the ad-hoc scripting to a minimum. So that it's easier to maintain, contribute, and not get too tied to a given tool (e.g. Vagrant)
</I>
Absolutely -- it would be really useful to have a reusable set of scripts that we could reuse across (e.g.) Docker and Vagrant.

Thomas Gazagnaire suggest pulling out opam-installext from the Docker scripts into an OPAM package so that we can just install it easily.

&gt;<i> * opam-in-a-box should be just that, a VM or container with a pre-installed OPAM. The provisionning command on the VM should be as simple as possible (one system-package install, opam init, one opam package install ; possibly one more command to serve some web pages)
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> * Now the tough part: setting up the account for a nice default user setup, with a possible choice of editors. For that I'm starting to work on the 'opam package for user setup' (opus ?) ('OCaml TOol Package for User Setup', 'octopus' ? :))
</I>
I guess this only applies for whole-VM virtualisation like Vagrant.  In the case of Docker packages, we can just skip all this and let the host editor work.  Do we have a page somewhere where we can editor customisation instructions easily?  Right now it's spread across Real World OCaml's installation instructions, the Merlin website, etc.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ## user-setup
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> user-setup is a small OCaml program intended to be used as an OPAM package with optional dependencies on every tool package it has a module for (e.g. merlin, ocp-indent, ocp-index...). Its role is simply to set up the configuration of the user to use the installed tools. The idea is to have a clean modular interface, with a module for each editor, containing:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - a base config template, to be used if the user has no config yet (typically, opam-in-a-box install)
</I>&gt;<i> - a list of chunks that need to be added to given editor files. We'll support update of these chunks with correct handling of manual modifications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> then for each tool (within each editor):
</I>&gt;<i> - a similar list of chunks
</I>&gt;<i> - a list of files to link or install
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll suppose a default configuration for most of this for now, the opam-in-a-box setting being the first use-case, and since advanced users probably won't use that anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing it this way has a bunch of advantages, among them:
</I>&gt;<i> - it should be easy to contribute configurations, and for this, contributions are highly needed (I've already put together a good emacs config from the various cited sources and my own to start, but am not qualified to do this for e.g. vim)
</I>&gt;<i> - it's flexible and allows updates: by using depopts, it will be re-run on every tool installation, change or upgrade, only for people to chose to install it.
</I>&gt;<i> - it's not normal for an opam package to write outside of ~/.opam, but here that'll be well advertised and kept to this one single package, without tainting tool packages themselves.
</I>
This sounds excellent.  What about managing `~/.ocamlinit` as well?  That's a very common missing step among RWO readers.
