Dear Ralf,

While you cannot specify dependencies directly in a dependency, you
can construct an OPAM remote that has `url` files that point directly
at the commit in question.

For example, https://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev has several such
instances with `url` files pointing to a specific fork or branch in git.

Your users will need to `opam repo add <name> <url>` of the OPAM
remote to pull in the new package descriptions.

regards,
Anil
