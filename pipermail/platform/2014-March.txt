Subject: [ocaml-platform] Passing OPAM data to build parameters
Message-ID: <5326E1CC.4000307@web.de>

Hello,

I am trying to become more familiar with software development tools for another
programming language.
How does the software "OCaml Package Manager" help to determine appropriate
build parameters?
Would you like to publish any more information about the cooperation of OPAM and
a command like "ocamlfind ocamlc -package"?

Regards,
Markus

OPAM 1.1 doesn't explicitly discover any build parameters.  Every package
defines a set of shell commands that can be modified depending on the presence
of dependent packages.  The package build system is responsible for parsing
these command-line elements and turning them into a set of ocamlfind packages.

This loose coupling was deliberate for OPAM 1.x, since it lets it work with
a large variety of build systems.  Moving forward, there are tentative designs
for tighter ocamlfind integration, but nothing beyond rough prototypes yet.

cheers,
Anil

I am curious about progress in this application area.

I have got some learning challenges to determine appropriate build parameters
for OCaml tools while extending my software development experience.
How do you think about a few more hints?

Markus

I'm writing up the results of some of my experiments, but it's not ready yet.

Louis has another experimental branch of OPAM which turns compilers into
packages, and that's also quite useful towards better integration of findlib.
I'll leave Louis to explain that, however.

As a followup to this, I've written a script that syncs all the
open pull requests against the compiler as OPAM compiler switches.
This is now running live on the central OPAM respository.

For instance, if you now `opam update` and look at your switches:

$ opam switch --all
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr10              Add String.{split,rsplit}
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr13              Add String.{cut,rcut}.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr14              Add absolute directory names to bytecode format for ocamldebug to use
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr15              replace String.blit by String.unsafe_blit
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr17              Cmm arithmetic optimisations
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr18              Patch for issue 5584
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr2               Parse -.x**2. (unary -.) as -.(x**2.).  Fix PR#3414
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr20              OCamlbuild: Fix the check of ocamlfind
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr3               Extend record punning to allow destructuring.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr4               Fix for PR#4832 (Filling bigarrays may block out runtime)
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr6               Warn user when a type variable in a type constraint has been instantiated.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr7               Extend ocamllex with actions before refilling
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr8               Adds a .gitignore to ignore all generated files during `make world.opt'
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr9               FreeBSD 10 uses clang by default, with gcc not available by default
--     -- 4.02.0dev+trunk             latest trunk snapshot

Each switch corresponds to the current development trunk, with the
diff in the PR applied.  If the patch is sane, you can proceed to
install OPAM packages in the experimental tree as usual without
affecting your day-to-day compiler switch.

Hope this is useful!  More details at:
http://anil.recoil.org/2014/03/25/ocaml-github-and-opam.html

It's set to run daily at the moment, and switches will be deleted once
the corresponding pull request is closed.

cheers,
Anil

This is incredible! Now let's get them all compiling and running unit tests

It is awfully useful. I was trying to setup an OPAM repository for simplifying the review of PR#22,
but you did it for me and all the others, thank you.

 I'm just wondering if it is wise to add all these switches to the default OPAM repository. For
casual ocaml user the useful switches are lost among all these PR.

  Perhaps the default possible switches can be reduced to the last releases (for people that work on
project that must support old version of ocaml) and to the beta and trunk for people that are
curious of the accepted new features.

  For ocaml compiler hackers a specific OPAM repository with all the svn branches and github PR can
be setup.

What do you think?

That's why in OPAM 1.1.1 we changed `opam switch list` to only display the default compilers, and you need to add `--all` to see all existing compiler descriptions. I think it's enough to address your concern.

But that doesn't prevent a specific repo of course.

Nice. Perhaps the user can still be scared by "The following NEW compilers are available:" that list
*all* the new switches. But my concerns are addressed, thanks.

I figured that for the course of Gabriel's experiment, we might as well keep it as simple as possible.  The only churn that casual users will see is a slightly more verbose 'opam update' as the switches come and go.

If it transpires that the full force of Mantis bugs move over to a system like this in the future, then I agree that we should maintain a separate remote instead.
