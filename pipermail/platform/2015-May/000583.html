<PRE>&gt;<i> - Daniel B&#252;nzli, 08/05/2015 20:24 -
</I>&gt;<i> Le vendredi, 8 mai 2015 &#224; 20:09, Ashish Agarwal a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Louis, thanks for your suggestions. I'm trying them out, but one quick question: how can you query with tags. I tried `opam list -e foobar`, and I seem to get the same output no matter what I write for foobar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not opam tags this is depexts tags (that correspond to platform). You can do for example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   opam search -s org:erratique
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it may not be entirely precise since opam-search matches not only in tags. I think opam-list should be able to filter by tags (I actually thought this was possible).  
</I>
Indeed. `opam list` has had too many features added one after the other, and it needs to be redesigned from scratch with clear filters and a well-defined operation between them [1]: its interface isn't very consistent and doesn't offer all the options we may want. I don't really have time at the moment though.

&gt;<i> Also, is there some convention for tags? You put &quot;org:&quot; as a prefix. Is there any special
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of this, now or planned in the future?
</I>
This is purely a convention, that is used for marking packages belonging to a given organisation; the only package tags with special meaning are the ones starting with `flags:` (these should actually be in the `flags:` top-level field instead, but using a tag provides better compatibility within the 1.2 branch).

Best,
Louis
