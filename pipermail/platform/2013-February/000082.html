<PRE>&gt;<i>This seems a little bit hackish to me, and likely to require more 
</I>&gt;<i>over-engineering (do we need a tool to create those .cmi files; if they 
</I>&gt;<i>are plain text file, it's ugly to use the .cmi extension).
</I>
I'm still not sure that they are really needed, but if they are the 
simplest thing to do would be to automatically generate some kind of 
&quot;core.std.cmn&quot; file whenever an mli file was compiled that contained &quot;in 
Core.Std&quot;. This would basically indicate that a &quot;Core.Std&quot; namespace 
existed and that some &quot;.cmi&quot; files in this directory used it.

&gt;<i>We use this quite intensively on LexiFi's code base.  This really speeds 
</I>&gt;<i>up compilation time under Windows, and we also use it to simplify 
</I>&gt;<i>deployment (our application is shipped with some .cmi files from many 
</I>&gt;<i>libraries and automatically compiles user-provided addins against them; 
</I>&gt;<i>it would be tedious -- and useless -- to reproduce a complete hierarchy 
</I>&gt;<i>of libraries on the installation side).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We would hate to have the third-party libraries we use adopt a new 
</I>&gt;<i>feature (namespaces) which solves a problem we don't have but forces us 
</I>&gt;<i>to change in non trivial ways how we organize our code base and deployment.
</I>
It is quite a specialised case, but I don't think it would be too hard to 
accommodate. If the compiler accepted filenames like &quot;list.1.cmi&quot; as 
possible files containing a &quot;List&quot; module, then you could safely put all 
your files in a single directory.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is basically an error, so dependencies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should not be expected to be correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't agree.  Having wrong dependencies is a nightmare to debug and 
</I>&gt;<i>during development having errors in the code is not an exceptional 
</I>&gt;<i>situation.  A robust build system should handle nicely things like 
</I>&gt;<i>moving files around, renaming them, etc.
</I>
I didn't mean that the build system wouldn't detect the error only that it 
wouldn't detect it until dependencies were recalculated.

&gt;<i>Imagine you have a big 
</I>&gt;<i>project with two modules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   foo/a.ml in namespace Foo
</I>&gt;<i>   bar/a.ml in namespace Bar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now you compile x.ml which refers to Foo # A. &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>reports that the dependencies for it include mode &quot;A&quot;, which must be 
</I>&gt;<i>mapped to all buildable a.cmi/a.cmx in your tree, i.e. both foo/a and 
</I>&gt;<i>bar/a.  (Things are even worse if you use the same syntax as for 
</I>&gt;<i>modules, because then any reference like Foo.A must be interpreted as a 
</I>&gt;<i>potential dependency to foo.cmi/cmx or to a.cmi/cmx.)  But maybe 
</I>&gt;<i>bar/a.ml refers to x.ml, and then you have a circular dependency.
</I>
This won't a problem if you use a build system specialised for OCaml, since 
they would know about namespaces and create the following dependencies:

x.ml: Foo#A
Foo#A: foo/a.ml
Bar#A: bar/a.ml

Even the makefile output of OCamlDep could be modified to avoid this 
problem using phony targets, although it is probably not worth it.

&gt;<i>I'd like any proposal about namespaces to come with a description of (i) 
</I>&gt;<i>how ocamldep is supposed to behave; (ii) how build systems (based on, 
</I>&gt;<i>say, make, omake and ocamlbuild) are supposed to be adapted.
</I>
For namespaces:

 - Whenever ocamldep encounters a line &quot;in A#B&quot; within c.mli then it creates
   a dependency &quot;A#B#C: c.mli&quot;.

 - Whenever it finds a use A#B#C in a file e.mli it creates a dependency 
   &quot;e.mli: A#B#C&quot;.

 - Build systems are modified to include support for phony namespace 
targets.
