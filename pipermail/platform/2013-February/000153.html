</I>
Yes, my initial proposal was about adding a &quot;(local) namespace opening&quot; 
statement to the language:

   open namespace Core

   let open namespace Core in ....

(Both would look for a core.ns file on the search path.)

I've simplified it even further by restricting its use to entire unit 
and putting the directive it on the command-line instead of the source 
code.  If the need for controlling locally which namespaces are used is 
felt, I won't object to it.  But I'm not yet convinced that this is so 
useful (and it complicates things, such as decicing how to display a 
nice type name in case of type error, because this depends on the 
location in your module).

&gt;<i> 2. Alain's proposal provides no means of aliasing namespaces. Similar to
</I>&gt;<i>     opening a namespace, it would be useful to be able to say &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> Core.Std as CS&quot; and then refer to Core_Std_Mutex as &quot;CS#Mutex&quot;
</I>
I believe that aliasing modules is what matters.  Since I don't 
understand the need for a dedicated notion of namespace yet (with some 
operations on namespaces) I also don't see the need for aliasing them.

&gt;<i> 2. A module's name depends on other files. A module's name (by which I
</I>&gt;<i>     mean its namespaced name) depends on the &quot;.ns&quot; file, this could
</I>&gt;<i> definitely be confusing.
</I>
I don't agree with this interpretation: the name of the module depends 
only on its file name, and we provide a convenient way for client code 
to refer to these modules with shorter names, locally.  It is a big 
advantage, for me, that client code could always be written without 
&quot;namespaces&quot;, if required.

&gt;<i> 3. They require you to manage an &quot;.ns&quot; file. Not a major burden, but it
</I>&gt;<i> is    one more place to look for errors. It also must be included in all
</I>&gt;<i>     calls to the compiler.
</I>
For any serious use of the compiler with some third-party libraries, the 
command-line is not built by hand, but by your build system and/or 
ocamlfind.

&gt;<i> 4. To me they put the namespace information in the wrong place. A
</I>&gt;<i> component should define its own names, it should also not have to open
</I>&gt;<i>     its own namespace.
</I>
I guess this is a matter of taste, and corresponds to a conception of 
what namespaces should be as an identified notion, rather than solving 
an actual need or addressing a concrete problem with my proposal 
(correct me if I'm wrong).

&gt;<i> As a side note, if people are okay with long filenames, why not support
</I>&gt;<i> having filenames like &quot;core-std-mutex.mli&quot; and then allow &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> namespace Core&quot; and &quot;open namespace Core#Std&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These could be treated as if there were automatically a &quot;core.ns&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> namespace Std = &quot;core-std.ns&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;core-std.ns&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> module Mutex = &quot;core-std-mutex.mli&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that were passed to any compiler invocation that had such files on its
</I>&gt;<i> search path.
</I>
I don't like this implicitness: how can we infer dependencies?  If 
ocamldep sees a reference to &quot;List&quot; in scope where &quot;open namespace Core&quot; 
and &quot;open namespace Bar&quot; are both active, it would have to look for both 
core-list and bar-list files (and there will be a combinatorial 
explosion in the resolution if you allow opening nested namespaces). 
Worse: if we use &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot;, this resolution has to be done by 
the build system, so this complex logic (which depends on the location 
in the source file) will have to be re-implemented in omake and other 
build systems around.  It is an important property that &quot;ocamldep 
-modules&quot; does not need to look for the existence of compiled units on 
the current tree.
