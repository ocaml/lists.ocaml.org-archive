<PRE>Hi,

I want to say that (not finished yet) proposal looks good to me. I like
the idea of being able to structure the environments into tree.
The reason why I think we should use hierarchy is:
- ability to structure several libraries into same &quot;shelves&quot; - looking
what Haskell does [1]: Control.Arrow or Data.Array. It will help to
provide one and consistent library for the platform. It does not
necessarily require (but enables) to use &quot;provenance&quot; style of naming
(e.g. Java convention)
- it enables us to pack some of the platform specific modules into
single name under some hierarchy, consider:

Win32 # System # Unix
Unix # System # Unix

now we are able to conveniently merge appropriate one of these during
compile time.

I'd like to emphasise that we would need to encourage people in a social
way to use the hierarchies wisely, and have some fixed conventions for
the community projects. One way to do this is the Platform itself - when
it will come with pre-bundled hierarchy people will start putting their
libraries into right shelves.

I'm a big fan of the DSL approach, and the spec have clear semantics
regarding namespaces - namespace a name for an environment.

I don't think I have anything other to say, beside that so far I like
it. Looking forward having more input in the proposal.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since about a year now, there has been a intermittent discussion ongoing on
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of introducing &quot;namespaces&quot; to the OCaml language. The basis for
</I>&gt;<i> discussion are some pain points of the current behavior of the current
</I>&gt;<i> implementation (all modules live in a flat space that is defined by the
</I>&gt;<i> search-path (-I command) and not very resilient to change), but there have
</I>&gt;<i> been fairly different ideas about how to best solve those problems, or even
</I>&gt;<i> what &quot;namespace&quot; means.
</I>&gt;<i> The current flat-module-space has mostly been felt by distributors of
</I>&gt;<i> largeish codebases designed not to be used in isolation, but required by
</I>&gt;<i> users code, in particular set of libraries for OCaml (in particular
</I>&gt;<i> JaneStreet Core or Batteries, and possibly components from the future OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> platform).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have worked on these issues last year with Didier Remy, and also Fabrice
</I>&gt;<i> Le Fessant and Nicolas Pouillard, and made an presentation at (the informal
</I>&gt;<i> part of) the last meeting the Caml Consortium. Here are a few documents we
</I>&gt;<i> we have written in the process:
</I>&gt;<i> - a design document: <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/spec.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - the slides of the talk:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/consortium-talk-2012.pdf">http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/namespaces/consortium-talk-2012.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I think the core problems with the current compilation unit lookup
</I>&gt;<i> system are rather consensual, there is little agreement on what a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> extension for the language or implementation would be, or if it is even
</I>&gt;<i> needed at all. The documents above take an intentionally &quot;rich&quot; approach of
</I>&gt;<i> the question, presenting a formal framework and language designed to be
</I>&gt;<i> rather expressive. It would be desirable to isolate a simpler feature set
</I>&gt;<i> that would cover the practical needs, but this needs to a careful
</I>&gt;<i> examination of the use cases, etc. I think people working or interested in
</I>&gt;<i> the OCaml Platform may have interesting inputs on the problems and use cases
</I>&gt;<i> at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A good example of the design trade-off involved is: who should have the
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility of choosing the names by which the OCaml user refers to
</I>&gt;<i> modules / software components on her system, the user itself or the
</I>&gt;<i> component provider? Letting users name things adds flexibility but also
</I>&gt;<i> complexity. Having a global shared namespace (eg. opam) makes the overall
</I>&gt;<i> design simpler, but also may also forbid some potentially interesting use
</I>&gt;<i> cases, such as users keeping version-pinned or modified versions of their
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies locally, and being able to explicitly refer either to the
</I>&gt;<i> standard version or the local version of a package. Do we want to forbid
</I>&gt;<i> that? Allow to pick one choice or the other in the global build system of
</I>&gt;<i> the developer's project? Let the developer use and link both standard and
</I>&gt;<i> local versions at the same time in a program, to compare them and make
</I>&gt;<i> tests, or if one dependency uses the standard version, and the other the
</I>&gt;<i> local one? Besides design trade-offs, there are also underlying
</I>&gt;<i> implementation questions, as the current OCaml linker has a rather
</I>&gt;<i> inflexible semantics in this regard.)
