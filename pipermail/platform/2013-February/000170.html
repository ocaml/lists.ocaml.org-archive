I want to see concrete examples!  I don't believe that it is common, in 
the same unit, to access two modules called &quot;List&quot; from two different 
libraries.  Maybe you want to use both String.Set and Int.Set, but 
you're not going to &quot;open&quot; String and Int anyway.  You may also want to 
use Xmllight.parse and Xmlm.parse (although it is not clear that this 
will happen in the same module), but you're not going to open Xmllight 
or Xmlm globally in your unit.

</I>
If put at the top of the file, I don't see them as fundamentally 
different from command-line arguments, and the meaning of the short name 
is decided by the order of open statements, which is also quite fragile.

And &quot;open statements&quot; (for modules, not even namespaces) are generally 
considered as a dangerous feature, because they are the source of 
technical problems (dependency analysis), because they make the code 
harder to read and refactorize, and because it makes modules more 
fragile (if a module B is extended with more components, they can hide 
components with the same name from another module A which is open before 
B in some client code).  Making &quot;opens&quot; more local is a way to reduce 
those problems.  I'm thus surprised by your claim that open statements 
are very good thing.


&gt;<i> They show which libraries the file is going to use.
</I>
This seems to confirm that what you're aiming at is really a way to 
specify in the source code which libraries are used.  But then we should 
push the reasoning further and ensure this specification is the only one 
required to use a library.  Why should we accept to pass -I / -pp / -ppx 
flags to the compiler (and specify again libraries at link time) when 
the information is already part of the source code?


&gt;<i> Currently, a file using a library that does not use pack will simply
</I>&gt;<i> launch straight into using modules with short names that give no
</I>&gt;<i> indication of their origin.
</I>
Many of the third-party libraries I use export a single module, which I 
never &quot;open&quot;, and whose name is unique enough to avoid clashes (e.g. 
Postgresql, Sqlite3, Xmlm).  Some libraries use prefixes (Nethtml, with 
an internal Nethtml_scanner module; Lwt comes with Lwt_util, 
Lwt_condition, Lwt_mutex, etc).  It would have been crazy, indeed, for 
Nethtml to have an internal &quot;Scanner&quot; module, or for Lwt to expose a 
&quot;Mutex&quot; module.  I'm fine with this situation, but I can understand that 
in some cases, it would make sense, for instance, to alias Lwt_mutex to 
Mutex in a given project.

So I don't agree with the opinion that -pack is currently the only way 
to avoid clashes!  It would be useful to get some statistics about the 
use of -pack in OPAM.


 &gt; I must look in the build system to find out
&gt;<i> what they refer to. By encouraging people to use namespaces, these files
</I>&gt;<i> will instead start with &quot;open namespace Foo&quot;, and it will be obvious
</I>&gt;<i> what libraries they are using.
</I>
So if you have a program like:

  open namespace Foo
  open namespace Bar

  (* ... several hundreds of lines ... *)

   .... Baz.parse ...

then, yes, you know that this program uses the Foo and Bar 
libraries/namespaces, but you have no idea where Baz comes from.  This 
is fine, as long as you don't have clashes of &quot;short&quot; names, i.e. Foo 
and Bar are different enough to not provide top-level components of the 
same name.

&gt;<i> As OPAM (and the platform) become more widely used I expect there to be
</I>&gt;<i> many more small convenience libraries. This will increase the number of
</I>&gt;<i> libraries that are being used within a single project, and it will be
</I>&gt;<i> useful to know from the source files themselves which files use which
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>
I like this idea of putting more information in the source code about a 
file &quot;requirements&quot; (let's say, which libraries are used).  This could 
be interpreted directly by the compiler (if there is a well-defined 
convention on how libraries are located and invoked) or by a driver such 
as ocamlfind.  Currently, library dependencies are specified on the 
command-line (hence in the build system) and I agree it makes sense to 
allow specifying that in the source code.

&gt;<i> I understand that for backwards compatibility it is useful to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> use files via both a namespaced name and a traditional name. However,
</I>&gt;<i> when not worried about backwards compatibility, we should instead be
</I>&gt;<i> focussed on providing a coherent story about how OCaml components are
</I>&gt;<i> named and how these names are managed. For me, this means (for a
</I>&gt;<i> non-backwards compatible library) only providing (or at least actively
</I>&gt;<i> encouraging) access to components through namespaces.
</I>
I understand your point and I think it makes sense if &quot;namespaces&quot; are 
indeed to be added to the language.

&gt;&gt;<i> Worse: if we use &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot;, this resolution has to be done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the build system, so this complex logic (which depends on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> location in the source file) will have to be re-implemented in omake
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and other build systems around.  It is an important property that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; does not need to look for the existence of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiled units on the current tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, I would like to make clear that this would be no problem for
</I>&gt;<i> build systems that used makefile formatted ocamldep output.
</I>
Indeed.  However, &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; has been added for good reasons 
and it is the recommended way to use omake.  (And don't know about 
ocamlbuild.)  omake is used by some of the largest OCaml code base around.

&gt;<i> &quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; has always produced an over-estimate of the modules
</I>&gt;<i> that a file uses and then allowed the build system to figure out the
</I>&gt;<i> rest.
</I>
&quot;ocamldep -modules&quot; does not produce more false dependencies than 
&quot;ocamldep&quot;.  I'd rather say that &quot;ocamldep&quot; (without -modules) misses 
some dependencies (for generated files which are not yet present when 
ocamldep is executed).


&gt;<i> OCamlDep would simply treat any namespace for which it could find
</I>&gt;<i> no &quot;.ns&quot; file as an implicit namespace.
</I>
I have to admit that I'm a little bit lost and I don't really know which 
&quot;namespace proposal&quot; we are talking about (mine has only &quot;.ns&quot; file, no 
other notion of namespaces).
