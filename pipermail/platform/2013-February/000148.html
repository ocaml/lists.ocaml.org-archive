Infrastructure is a relative question.  Core and Async are both
libraries that want this.  But there are more we have internally.
Indeed, we mint a fair number of little programming worlds, each with
their own conventions that are encoded by such a Std library.  There
aren't hundreds of these, but there are probably a dozen.

Generally, it's important to remember the importance of scale.  Jane
Street has a hundred people actively hacking on OCaml every day,
millions of lines of codes and hundreds of software artifacts.  Things
that seem like occasional special cases become first-class
requirements pretty quick.

</I>&gt;<i> specific code base) and to avoid one extra &quot;open&quot; statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is default behavior of OCaml of opening Pervasives by
</I>&gt;<i> default. This can be switched of.  Now if Core has to be thought as
</I>&gt;<i> a different standard library, why should we require users to even
</I>&gt;<i> write &quot;open Core.Std&quot; at all?  We should be able to arrange so that
</I>&gt;<i> the compiler opens it by default as it usually opens Pervasives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, for me, this is quite orthogonal to module name management (which can
</I>&gt;<i> be useful to many libraries) and is rather specific to stdlib replacement /
</I>&gt;<i> basic infrastructure libraries.
</I>
I very much disagree.  This is a common enough primitive that people
should be able to do it without hacking the build system.  Indeed,
Daniel seems to have the same requirements as we do.
