I'd say &quot;using&quot; the build system rather than hacking it.  Actually, it 
is more about using ocamlfind.  We will anyway need to rely on ocamlfind 
to manage the installation of many libraries, right?  I think that users 
don't really care that passing &quot;-package core&quot; to ocamlfind will result 
in it passing the following three options to the compiler:

   -I ..../core/core.ns
            (* To &quot;open&quot; the the default mapping provided by core *)

   -open Core_std
            (* To open the default module which, in particular,
               overrides definitions in Pervasives. *)

   -I ..../core
            (* So that you can use long names like Core_list if you
               wish, to be explicit *)

(and probably some -ppx options as well :-))


(There could variants like a &quot;-package core.raw&quot; which would only pass 
the third one.)

Do you agree that the information about which libraries are used by a 
specific part of the code base will be part of the build system anyway?

Now we could discuss putting library-related information in the client 
code itself (this is a common request for &quot;syntax extensions&quot;, but I 
don't see why this is specific to them), e.g. in the form of special 
comments/attributes understood by ocamlfind, but this seems a different 
topic to me.
