I agree.  I would like to let users flexibly redefine namespaces, and
to have multiple namespaces for the same modules.  One example of the
use of this that I'd have in Core is Core.Std and Core.Stable.

Core.Std is the standard thing you open if you want to use Core in the
ordinary way.  Nothing to see here.

Core.Stable exports just a subset of Core, in particular, a set of
so-called &quot;stable&quot; types that are guaranteed not to change from
release to release.  (there are explicit version numbers attached to
these to allow new versions to be minted without changing the old.)
This is useful for building protocols that OCaml programs can
communicate with even when they're built with different versions of
Core.

It would be ideal if the namespace proposal supported this use case,
and once it does, well, it seems like you almost need to have the
flexibility you describe.
