Not true. The success of the Platform is to deliver something that
will be used by serious users of OCaml, and to learn from their experiences
at the same time.  We obviously don't intend to take years doing it, but
there's also no mad rush to lash something up in a few weeks.

&gt;<i> Voting is just a quick way to come with an actionnable item. I care
</I>&gt;<i> about delivering something in the near future. If there is no obvious

</I>
In this case voting won't lead to any actionable items. Therefore it's
largely a waste of time.  The discussion to date has been extremely
useful, however.

If you have concerns about the timeline or progress, please feel free
to contact me directly and I'll resolve any issues.  Progress has been
great in the past few months, especially with the uptake of OPAM (which
was intended to be the base control plane for future Platform releases,
hence it has support for custom compiler switches and sophisticated
constraints).
