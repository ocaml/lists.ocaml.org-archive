<PRE>I don't like your lazy initialization scheme because it changes the
observable semantics of the the OCaml language when modules have
global side-effects. Currently, the effects are evaluated in the
linking order of the modules, not the use order.

Note that the main difficulty of your proposal is to track
dependencies at a structure item level, rather than at a compilation
unit level as is currently done. Lazyness is arguably bad and in any
case not needed if you have this finer granularity -- but as I argued
this would have large, and possibly unpleasant, implementation
implications.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for that explanation.  I have some questions though.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At run-time a module is a record. Initialising a module involves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initialising every component of the module and placing them in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> record. Initialising these components can involve executing arbitrary

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initialisation of all its modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about doing that initialization in a more lazy fashion?
</I>&gt;<i> Initializing a module would only create the top level components:
</I>&gt;<i> toplevel values and modules&#185;, the modules being only &quot;pointers to
</I>&gt;<i> NULL&quot;.  when accessing a submodule, the compiler would take note to
</I>&gt;<i> initialize that submodule (and link the corresponding cmo/cmx for
</I>&gt;<i> packed modules&#178;).  If the modules is used in a functor or as a first
</I>&gt;<i> class value, then all submodules present in the signature are
</I>&gt;<i> initialized (this could be on the spot &#8212; especially for the toplevel &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> or moved to the place where the module is initialized if that makes a
</I>&gt;<i> difference).  To avoid runtime checks, some static analysis is
</I>&gt;<i> required to make sure that, when a value is used, the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> submodule has been properly initialized but that may not be too hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two problems that I can see with this but I think namespaces
</I>&gt;<i> have the same ones if they are to be convenient.  The first is about
</I>&gt;<i> the initialization code in submodules.  As you say, loading a library
</I>&gt;<i> should execute the &quot;toplevel code&quot; of each submodule.  Since this is
</I>&gt;<i> rather infrequent, when building the module record, one may add all
</I>&gt;<i> module paths containing submodules with initialization code.  That way
</I>&gt;<i> the current semantics are preserved and for huge packed modules many
</I>&gt;<i> components should still go away.  However, one could argue that if one
</I>&gt;<i> does not reference the module at all, its initialization code should
</I>&gt;<i> not be executed (alike the behavior one gets when adding cm[x]a on the
</I>&gt;<i> command line).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second problem is that some toplevel value may need some sumodules
</I>&gt;<i> to be initialized (because they use these submodules).  Some analysis
</I>&gt;<i> is thus required to add these submodules during the record
</I>&gt;<i> initialization.  The same is true when one initialize a submodule that
</I>&gt;<i> was &quot;NULL&quot; before &#8212; other submodules may need to be initialized first.
</I>&gt;<i> This analysis may not be too had to do &#8212; indeed it is already
</I>&gt;<i> basically present in ocamldep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#185; As an added bonus, one does not have to load the entire module
</I>&gt;<i> signature (&#8776;4Mb for Core) &#8212; only keep pointers to the signatures of
</I>&gt;<i> submodules &#8212; which should speed up compilation.  This is mostly an
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonal issue but it could benefit from the same laziness framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#178; This could be done almost for free if packing would rename the
</I>&gt;<i> modules to some internal names, gather them in a cm[x]a (and not a
</I>&gt;<i> cmo/cmx as of now) and add a module aliasing these internal names to
</I>&gt;<i> the desired names for the outside world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any attempt to overcome the problems with pack, whilst still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintaining the illusion that the &quot;pack&quot; is a normal module, would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result (at the very least) in one of the following unhealthy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situations:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The module type of the &quot;pack&quot; module would depend on which of its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   components were accessed by the program.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Any use of the &quot;pack&quot; module other than as a simple container
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   (e.g. &quot;module CS = Core.Std&quot;) could have a dramatic effect on what was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   linked into the program and potentially on the semantics of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe one of these problems occurs with the rough proposal described
</I>&gt;<i> above but it is not immediately clear to me.  May you tell?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Namespaces are basically modules that can only be used as a simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> container. This means that they do not need a corresponding record at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run-time (or any other run-time representation). This avoids the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems with pack as well as enabling other useful features
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. open definitions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that openness may be a desired feature.  Gabriel however said
</I>&gt;<i> that it is not essential.  Moreover, one could imagine that a module
</I>&gt;<i> wanting to be added to a hierarchy (say &quot;Data&quot;) could be repacked at
</I>&gt;<i> in the module Data at installation time.  Granted this is not very
</I>&gt;<i> nice but this is just intended to show that there are short term
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> C.
