<PRE>I should mention that the term &quot;UNSANITARY&quot; might sound a bit
negative, but that is not intended.  My actual opinion is that Alain's
proposal sounds to me quite practical, and is basically my favorite
proposal thus far (though I consider my own opinion to be of limited
value, because of my lack of understanding of many implementation
issues).  I just wanted for us to call out the downsides explicitly,
so as to better understand what the opposition to Alain's plan might
be.

</I>
That sounds dandy.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Leo, do you have a summary of what you don't like about Alain's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace proposal?  I'm not presently able to identify any obvious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weaknesses in it.  The downsides I see are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - UNSANITARY: Having both &quot;open namespace Core.Std&quot; and Core_List as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   names seems a little unsanity.  Indeed, to provide a decent user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   experience, you probably want to hide the Core_List name almost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   everywhere.  You don't want it showing up in error messages,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   documentation, source files, etc.  When you need to do a bunch of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   work to hide something, maybe it's better not to include it at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to point out that Alain's idea of using long, hopefully-unique
</I>&gt;<i> names for the source files, that you deem &quot;unsanitary&quot; here, is also a
</I>&gt;<i> workaround for the problem of internal name conflict. In Alain's
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, internal names conflicts are (hopfeully) avoided with no
</I>&gt;<i> implementation change, just by judicious name choices and letting the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation do its work. This imposes this &quot;unsanitary&quot; aspect you
</I>&gt;<i> mention, but it is a complexity tradeoff: the other alternative would
</I>&gt;<i> be to design a more clever implementation to choose internal names
</I>&gt;<i> (than the module's source filename), which could be hidden from the
</I>&gt;<i> user (no exposed Core_List) but require an implementation change. I
</I>&gt;<i> think that could warrant an exploration (because it could support use
</I>&gt;<i> cases such as linking together two versions of the same library, which
</I>&gt;<i> isn't possible with a purely filename-based solution), but in the
</I>&gt;<i> context Alain's proposal this &quot;unsanitary&quot; aspect has more advantages
</I>&gt;<i> than downsides.
</I>
I don't disagree with any of this.

&gt;&gt;<i> - NO HIDING: I'm not sure that the other namespace proposals do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   support this, but I'd like to be able to hide some modules so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   they are not reachable outside of the namespace.  We can do this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   with the current Core.Std, but I don't see how to do it in Alain's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm surprised by this &quot;hiding&quot; idea. What does it mean, and what would
</I>&gt;<i> be an use case for that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there other issues I'm missing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My gut feeling is that a hierarchical model would add little
</I>&gt;<i> complexity to Alain's proposal and give a saner semantics to &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> namespace&quot;. With a flat model there can be no real notion of &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> namespace&quot;, only handcrafted renamings en masse (Core_list -&gt; List,
</I>&gt;<i> Core_array -&gt; Array...). (On the other hand &quot;open namespace&quot;, if they
</I>&gt;<i> are done at the source level, are a source language change, while none
</I>&gt;<i> are necessary so far, so they will require more work to handle in any
</I>&gt;<i> case.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is the problem of internal name conflicts, but that is one of
</I>&gt;<i> the more &quot;advanced&quot; questions that may be left out of a first
</I>&gt;<i> experiment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When deciding to leave out some questions for later, it is however
</I>&gt;<i> important to wonder whether we're sure that we will actually be able
</I>&gt;<i> to extend the design to support them. Some early design choices may
</I>&gt;<i> make future extensions harder (without breaking compatibility). One
</I>&gt;<i> solution is to make a coherent design that covers advanced features,
</I>&gt;<i> and decide to implement only a subset. One other is to try to guess
</I>&gt;<i> what will be easy to add afterwards, and be lucky. Finally, one can
</I>&gt;<i> experiment with a first design and move to another, but without
</I>&gt;<i> committing to backward compatibility (meaning no language release
</I>&gt;<i> between the two design iterations).
</I>
I appreciate your point about picking a modest design.  I would argue,
however, that it's not worth actually implementing a namespace
mechanism that doesn't handle the case of a library like Core.  I
think libraries like Core are really one of the biggest drivers for
namespaces, and it would seem a mistake to build and deploy something
that doesn't solve that problem.

&gt;<i> My personal guess is that
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;flat access&quot; will be easy an easy extension.
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;hierarchical rather than flat mappings&quot; will be relatively easy in
</I>&gt;<i> theory but make a painful transition period for providers that have
</I>&gt;<i> modules organized flatly and desire to change; but it depends on a
</I>&gt;<i> question of &quot;seeing non-leaf namespaces as modules&quot; that Alain's flat
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces don't need to consider.
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;extending the mapping description language&quot; must be planned for
</I>&gt;<i> beforehand to avoid growing pains.
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;finer implementation of internal names to avoid linking conflicts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is yet of unknown difficulty, either today and after any first
</I>&gt;<i> proposal not tackling this aspect is acted upon.
</I>
This all sounds reasonable.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I understand your point Alain, but while what you're saying is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> technically reasonable, I think it doesn't hold together.  When
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> programming in the large, it is useful to be able to manipulate the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> namespace and group parts of the world together.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Can you give concrete examples of which manipulations are desired (and why)?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the conversation has gotten confused.  You said &quot;who needs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pack?  Just use hierarchically named modules&quot;.  I'm saying: that's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crazy, you need to be able to do simple manipulations of namespaces
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (like the ones implied by &quot;open Core.Std&quot; or &quot;open Core.Stable&quot;.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now you're pointing out that your namespace proposal covers the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> manipulations I'm describing.  That may well be right, and I wasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contesting that point.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> All I'm saying is that simply relying on long module names without any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kind of explicit namespace control does not scale.  I stand by that,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without necessarily objecting to your namespace proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Many libraries, not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just Core or Async, want to be able to remap the world by adding a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> collection of related names to the namespace.  The ability to do the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> moral equivalent of:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     open Core.Std
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is powerful and important.  Your proposal of having people add
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prefixes to module names does not fit the bill, and the resulting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system does not, in my opinion, scale.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I believe my proposal covers this use case.  If you depend a lot on a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specify library which exports many modules, you might indeed want to avoid
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> using long names everywhere to access these modules.  That's why I propose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to give simple ways to alias long modules names to short ones, in a way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which can be factorized (with external mapping files).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In my proposal, the equivalent of &quot;open Core.Std&quot; would simply be to tell
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the compiler (through a command-line option or with a directive in the code)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to use a mapping file.  The same can be done within the library itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here is a minimalistic version of my proposal, restricted to specifying
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those mapping files on the compiler and tools command-lines.  To make it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clear that this is only about mapping module references to compiled units,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> let's piggy-back the -I option.  If its argument is a file with a .ns suffix
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and not a directory, the compiler interprets it as a mapping file (a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sequence of lines of the form &quot;Module_name =
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> relative_path_to_compiled_unit&quot;, e.g. &quot;List = core_list&quot;), and when this -I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> option is considered during the resolution of a module reference (such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;List&quot;) and the module is defined in the file, the compiler simply resolves
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the module to the corresponding unit.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This approach could also be used to restrict which units are visible by the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compiler (and avoid repeated lookup on the file system) without moving files
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> around on the file system.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ocamldep (without -modules) would apply the same logic; ocamldep -modules
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could either implement the same logic, or leave it to the build system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> interpreting its output (allowing more dynamic scenarios where the mapping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> file themselves are generated).  I expect ocamldoc to work mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> out-of-the-box, even though one could think about using the mapping files
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (in reverse direction) to provide shorter names in the generated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> documentation (or not).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Users of a library are never forced to use the mapping files, and they can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> always refer to a module with its full name (provided the corresponding -I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;path&gt; is used).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The OCaml stdlib would be adapted to use longer names (stdlib_list,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stdlib_array, etc) and shipped with a stdlib.ns file opened by default
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (unless -nostdlib is used).  To be clear: this mapping file will be used by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the stdlib itself, so references within itself don't need to use long names.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm interested to see concrete examples of manipulation or scenarios not be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> covered by this proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am unaware of any.  I think this does mostly support the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Core.Std/Core.Stable tricks we use.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One thing I'll say is that it is important to be able to add values,
