Concretly, what should the OCamldoc-generated page for a Core module 
look like?  Should the reference to types defined in other Core modules 
be displayed without any indication that they come from Core (without 
clicking on it)?  I would find this very confusing.  Similarly for error 
messages: it is indeed nice to be able to see List instead of Core_list 
when you live with Core all you day long and there is no ambiguity. 
Still, there needs to be a way to have a more explicit error message, 
which could distinguish Stdlib_list from Core_list.  For me, seeing List 
instead Core_list in &quot;common cases&quot; is only nice to have (and definitely 
achievable with a little more effort in my proposal), but being able to 
distinguish Core_list from Stdlib_lib is crucial.  (And I don't think 
that showing Core#List is nicer than Core_list, at least not enough to 
justify the addition of a new notion.)

Having long unique names which can be used in any context is a very good 
property and would also avoid problems reported with camlp4 extensions 
not being able to access a specific &quot;standard&quot; module.  If we can use 
Stdlib_list in any context, we don't need to do any hack to refer to it.

</I>&gt;<i>    proposal.

If the library does not install the .cmi file of the private module, it 
cannot be accessed by any &quot;client code&quot;.  We do this regularly for our 
internal libraries.  For me, this is not really related to namespaces.

With my proposal, it is even better: you can install .cmi files so that 
some &quot;privileged&quot; parts of your code base can still access it, but also 
restrict access to other parts by providing a mapping file which does 
not alias the private module (and just arrange so that you don't have a 
-I on the directory where the .cmi is installed).  Currently, what we do 
to achieve it is to have several install directories for some libraries 
and copy a different subset of .cmi files to each of them.
