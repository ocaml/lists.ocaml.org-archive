&quot;forced&quot; was maybe too strong... :-)

Well, it is not a bad solution, but packing allows to open the library
at once. Not to say that this is a must have but I find it convenient
in practice.


&gt;<i>  Maybe this solution is not so good for libraries whose goal
</I>&gt;<i> is

</I>&gt;<i> is

</I>&gt;<i> language (I don't have the impression to use a library when I write
</I>&gt;<i> String.length or List.map, contrary to when I write Xmlm.make_input);
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> I understand why Jane Street is reluctant to have Core_list.map
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere in their code.  But would it really be a problem to have
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> users write &quot;open Kaputt_abbreviations&quot; instead of &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> Kaputt.Abbreviations&quot;, or Bolt_logger.log instead of Bolt.Logger.log?
</I>
For those libraries, with few modules, it could be a decent solution.
But for Barista (with 50+ modules), it is nice to be able to open the
library as mentioned above. Moreover, library code is also made lighter
by packing: in another Bolt module, &quot;Logger.log&quot; is sufficient (there
is no ambiguity) while your solution would imply to write &quot;Bolt_logger.log&quot;.

It just occurs to me that packing obviously allows (or enforces)
&quot;closed&quot; namespaces: no one can add a module to the packed module.
Is the ability to &quot;close&quot; a namespace something considered useful?
