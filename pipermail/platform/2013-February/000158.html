I think we agree on why we disagree.  For me, the only problem which is 
serious enough to justify changes to the language and toolchain is about 
name clashes (not being able to use two libraries together because they 
happen to use identical module names).  A simple non-technical solution 
exists today: a policy to avoid such clashes (long names). The only 
cases where this is problematic, I believe, is for big libraries used in 
a pervasive way, for which (i) long names become really tedious for the 
users; (ii) module aliasing is not enough because the library has many 
modules.  I think this is fairly limited and can be solved by very light 
additions to the toolchain, allowing basically to define &quot;user-land 
stdlibs&quot; (with a context-dependent definition of what a stdlib is).  I 
consider other use cases and &quot;required&quot; features of namespaces as nice 
to have (or not) but not important enough to justify any serious 
addition to the language definition and adaptation of existing tools, 
especially when we are talking about breaking some current invariants 
and properties on which some existing users might rely.
