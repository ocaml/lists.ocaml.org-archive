I think the conversation has gotten confused.  You said &quot;who needs
pack?  Just use hierarchically named modules&quot;.  I'm saying: that's
crazy, you need to be able to do simple manipulations of namespaces
(like the ones implied by &quot;open Core.Std&quot; or &quot;open Core.Stable&quot;.)

Now you're pointing out that your namespace proposal covers the
manipulations I'm describing.  That may well be right, and I wasn't
contesting that point.

All I'm saying is that simply relying on long module names without any
kind of explicit namespace control does not scale.  I stand by that,
without necessarily objecting to your namespace proposal.

&gt;&gt;<i> Many libraries, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just Core or Async, want to be able to remap the world by adding a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collection of related names to the namespace.  The ability to do the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moral equivalent of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     open Core.Std
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is powerful and important.  Your proposal of having people add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prefixes to module names does not fit the bill, and the resulting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system does not, in my opinion, scale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe my proposal covers this use case.  If you depend a lot on a
</I>&gt;<i> specify library which exports many modules, you might indeed want to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> using long names everywhere to access these modules.  That's why I propose
</I>&gt;<i> to give simple ways to alias long modules names to short ones, in a way
</I>&gt;<i> which can be factorized (with external mapping files).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my proposal, the equivalent of &quot;open Core.Std&quot; would simply be to tell
</I>&gt;<i> the compiler (through a command-line option or with a directive in the code)
</I>&gt;<i> to use a mapping file.  The same can be done within the library itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a minimalistic version of my proposal, restricted to specifying
</I>&gt;<i> those mapping files on the compiler and tools command-lines.  To make it
</I>&gt;<i> clear that this is only about mapping module references to compiled units,
</I>&gt;<i> let's piggy-back the -I option.  If its argument is a file with a .ns suffix
</I>&gt;<i> and not a directory, the compiler interprets it as a mapping file (a
</I>&gt;<i> sequence of lines of the form &quot;Module_name =
</I>&gt;<i> relative_path_to_compiled_unit&quot;, e.g. &quot;List = core_list&quot;), and when this -I
</I>&gt;<i> option is considered during the resolution of a module reference (such as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;List&quot;) and the module is defined in the file, the compiler simply resolves
</I>&gt;<i> the module to the corresponding unit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This approach could also be used to restrict which units are visible by the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler (and avoid repeated lookup on the file system) without moving files
</I>&gt;<i> around on the file system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ocamldep (without -modules) would apply the same logic; ocamldep -modules
</I>&gt;<i> could either implement the same logic, or leave it to the build system
</I>&gt;<i> interpreting its output (allowing more dynamic scenarios where the mapping
</I>&gt;<i> file themselves are generated).  I expect ocamldoc to work mostly
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-the-box, even though one could think about using the mapping files
</I>&gt;<i> (in reverse direction) to provide shorter names in the generated
</I>&gt;<i> documentation (or not).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Users of a library are never forced to use the mapping files, and they can
</I>&gt;<i> always refer to a module with its full name (provided the corresponding -I
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;path&gt; is used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OCaml stdlib would be adapted to use longer names (stdlib_list,
</I>&gt;<i> stdlib_array, etc) and shipped with a stdlib.ns file opened by default
</I>&gt;<i> (unless -nostdlib is used).  To be clear: this mapping file will be used by
</I>&gt;<i> the stdlib itself, so references within itself don't need to use long names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm interested to see concrete examples of manipulation or scenarios not be
</I>&gt;<i> covered by this proposal.
</I>
I am unaware of any.  I think this does mostly support the
Core.Std/Core.Stable tricks we use.

One thing I'll say is that it is important to be able to add values,
and not just modules, to the namespace.  Open Core.Std also adds
top-level values, as does the traditional standard library (i.e.,
Pervasives), and I don't want to lose that.
