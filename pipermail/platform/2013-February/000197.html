<PRE>&gt;<i> I agree with your point about settilng deep semantic issues ahead of
</I>&gt;<i> syntactic one.  I would however submit that the question of whether
</I>&gt;<i> you should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Have opens in the language proper, including local opens
</I>&gt;<i> - Have renames for namespaces in the language proper
</I>
Yes, this is  the minimal, and probably agreed on.

The main question whether namespaces are hierarchical or flat is still not
answered, Flat namespaces are not much of an extension to OCaml and do not
raise many questions about their semantics.  This is the benefit of Alain's
proposal---but also its weakness to be limited in expressiveness.

If namespaces are hierarchical, the simplest model is that of a graph where
inner nodes are namespaces, leave nodes are module objects, edges are
names (and directed).

One question raised is whether edges should also carry auto-open flags, so
that whenever a node is opened all other nodes reachable by auto-open edges
are also opened.  This feature is strongly desired by Yaron, but it raises
further issues...

There is no reason for having just one such edge. Indeed, the idea is to
break big modules into smaller ones so that only actually used modules need
to be linked. The same should hold for auto-open modules.

However, since opening modules is not commutative, auto-open edges must be
ordered.  This means that the mental model to give to the user is not just
a directed graph with label edges whose leaves are module objects, as
described above, but whose edges (at least those flagged auto-opened) are
also ordered.  I think this is a bit more complicated and not so nice that
edges need to be both ordered and named...

The problem comes from module leaves.  For inner nodes one could check the
absence of conflicting names at the end of auto-open edges when building
namespaces so that the order of opens would not matter.  But one cannot do
so for leaves, because modules should remain opaque to namespaces (I think),
hence conflicts cannot be detected when building the namespace,

Yet another question raised by auto-open flags, which Gabriel and I
discussed  today is how auto-open behaves on access paths.  Assume,
for instance, a namespace containing:

         ROOT . --Core--&gt; C --Pervasives*--&gt; M
                           \
                             --Std*--&gt; S

and that the module M contains a submodule List.  Should the user always
write Core#Pervasives#List or could he simply write Core#List, since given
that Pervasives is auto-open it could have just written

            open Core
            List

to designate module M.List. Indeed, one could expect that both

         let open path in Name
and
         path#Name

return the same object.  This way, the ordinary user would not need to know
about the Pervasives module.  Only the expert user who wishes to open just
the Pervasives module and not its parent will have to know its existence and
write

         open Core#Pervasive

Unfortunately, this choice of semantics implies that paths must be
interpreted in a much more complex way: path#name need not only look at the
node at path for an edge labeled Name but also at all nodes (recursively)
reachable by auto-open edges!

With these (small) complications in mind, do we still wish to have
auto-open edges? It this the good model?

----------------

In their absence, one would have to perform the auto-opens manually, and
the order of opens would therefore be given by the user.

The reason for auto-opens is to allow the user to just write

         open Core

instead of

         open Core
         open Pervasive
         open Std

Perhaps, an alternative to auto-open would be to allow one to write open
directives in .ns files as well. Then, a file myenv.ns could both build a
namespace and pre-open some of the nodes, including some of its leaves.  The
user could then just put something as concise as

         use myenv.ns

at the top of his *.ml files. And if he opens myenv.ns he will have a very
clear idea of what names should be visible.

Just an idea, which I don't like so much either.  But is shows that there
are still important details to be thought of and choices to be made.

----------------

Notice that the problem comes from the fact that leaves of namespaces are
opaque modules (and I think modules should remain opaque to namespaces), and
as a result conflicting interfaces of modules cannot be detected when
building a namespace, combined with the fact that the open construct of the
module language is not itself strict (i.e. it may override bindings) and
thus does not commute.
