<PRE>TLDR; I agree with the parts of proposal suggesting statement &quot;namespace
X&quot; to be introduced to .ml and .mli files and then statements &quot;open
namespace X&quot;, &quot;let namespace Y = X&quot; and their expression forms. And that
this all should be controlled from the source code, not the build
system.

&gt;<i>   My biggest objection to having opens be at the build system level is
</I>&gt;<i>   that it makes your code more ambiguous.  When you do namespace
</I>&gt;<i>   manipulations, you very much want to see what's happening by

</I>&gt;<i>   and I don't want to start adding code review of the build rules to
</I>&gt;<i>   it, and this change would require that.
</I>
I agree that namespaces should be defined and accessed through the
source code. Not the least because it depends on the project's chosen
build system on how I should go on changing those definitions. While
currently the situation is the same regarding findlib package
management, I think it is worth considering that perhaps this kind of
namespace system could automatically lead into the build system
(ocamldep?)  inferring which packages you need to use and eliminate that
piece of configuration from the build system. Only special cases would
need more configuration.

While C++ might not be the golden standard to look upon on language
development, perhaps it can serve as an inspiration. Its namespace
system seems to work pretty nicely without complaints from the
developers. It has the following constructs:

namespace X {
  /* introduce values for the namespace X */
  int a = 42;
  namespace Z {
    /* introduce namespace X::Z */
    int b = a;
  }
}

namespace X {
  /* introduce more values for the namespace X */
  int z = 5;
}

namespace Y = X; /* alias a namespace */

int b = X::a; /* access a value in a namespace */

using namespace X; /* bring X to current scope (works in function scope
                      as well */

using X::a; /* bring one value from a namespace to current scope */

In implementation side it works by simply relabeling symbols in the
generated object files which makes the namespaces open.

C++'s compilation system with include files is of course very different
from OCaml, but a similar solution to OCaml would mean having a hidden
internal name (such as namespace_modulename or possibly even something
that like namespace#modulename) for the module created from that
compilation unit. It would need to be limited to a single top-level
namespace specification per compilation unit, so it would work sort of
in reverse compared to C++. For example if x.ml contained statement
&quot;namespace Foo&quot;, a module Foo#X would be generated instead of plain X.

This solution would not allow the same module names from different
namespaces to coexist in a single directory, but I don't see this as an
essential feature. The source file names already would be the same, and
OCaml compiler produces object files to the same directory as the
source. If you have a build system copying files around, it could (and
perhaps should!) preserve the directory hierarchy.

&gt;<i> - NAMESPACES WITH VALUES.  I have argued for allowing the opening of a
</I>&gt;<i>   namespace to also implicitly open some modules, this essentially
</I>
The previosuly described system would also eliminate the C++-like
ability of introducing values to a namespace, unless special module
names or other changes, such as an automatic opening of some modules,
are implemented. It would be nice to be able to define such top-level
values from multiple compilation units, but I'm uncertain how that would
be implemented.

This approach would need the compiler to find many similarly named .cmi
files and decide the proper one to use based on their contents, as
mentioned in a previous proposal.

Everyone seems to agree that # is a good operator for accessing modules
(or values) from namespaces. Or maybe we could go with \ ;-).

&gt;<i>   But what Alain is proposing is to make opening a namespace silent at
</I>&gt;<i>   the source level.  This strikes me as a grave error.
</I>
I agree. At worst this could mean that in large projects developers let
the build system recompile their files so they can see what namespaces
they are using. It seems much better to me to just read it from the
source code, which is the same regardless of the project.
