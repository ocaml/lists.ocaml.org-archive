&gt;<i> Let me try to summarize the current situation about the argument

</I>&gt;<i> same page, but I may be missing things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - MAKING LONG NAMES AVAILABLE.  Alain prefers to have unambiguous long
</I>&gt;<i>   names that are usable in a first class way.  I find this mildly
</I>&gt;<i>   distasteful, but would be OK with it as long as it was well hidden
</I>&gt;<i>   from the user by default.  Long names shouldn't show up by default
</I>&gt;<i>   in source files, error messages or documentation.  I view this as
</I>&gt;<i>   quite important for usability of namespaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - SOURCE-LEVEL OPENS.  Alain would prefer to have namespace
</I>&gt;<i>   manipulations restricted to the command line, and therefore the
</I>&gt;<i>   build system.  He thinks of namespaces as something that should be
</I>&gt;<i>   used pretty rarely (or at least, there should be very few
</I>&gt;<i>   namespaces), and it's therefore OK to push them to the outside.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Leo and I both believe this is a big mistake.  We expect opens to
</I>&gt;<i>   happen fairly commonly, and for there to be many different libraries
</I>&gt;<i>   that are organized as namespaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Alain doubts that there would be many module-name clashes.  I
</I>&gt;<i>   disagree on this point as does Leo.  We use packed modules
</I>&gt;<i>   pervasively (for /every/ library), and as a result, we have lots of
</I>&gt;<i>   little namespaces, and lots of repeated names within them (names
</I>&gt;<i>   like Common, Protocol, Spec, Config, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   My biggest objection to having opens be at the build system level is
</I>&gt;<i>   that it makes your code more ambiguous.  When you do namespace
</I>&gt;<i>   manipulations, you very much want to see what's happening by
</I>&gt;<i>   inspecting the source.  We have a vigorous code review system here,
</I>&gt;<i>   and I don't want to start adding code review of the build rules to
</I>&gt;<i>   it, and this change would require that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Alain's claim that opens are a bad thing also seems wrong to me.
</I>&gt;<i>   opens should be rare, but all of our proposals involve the
</I>&gt;<i>   equivalent of opening a namespace.  Alain is not saying we should
</I>&gt;<i>   have none of that (after all, we're all glad that Pervasives is
</I>&gt;<i>   opened!).  But what Alain is proposing is to make opening a
</I>&gt;<i>   namespace silent at the source level.  This strikes me as a grave
</I>&gt;<i>   error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - NAMESPACES WITH VALUES.  I have argued for allowing the opening of a
</I>&gt;<i>   namespace to also implicitly open some modules, this essentially
</I>&gt;<i>   adding values to the search path in addition to modules.  I would be
</I>&gt;<i>   sad to lose this feature, but I don't think it's absolutely
</I>&gt;<i>   essential.  It would merely add boilerplate.  Roughly speaking,
</I>&gt;<i>   every time a user of Core writes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      open namespace Core#Std
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   instead of
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      open namespace Core#Std
</I>&gt;<i>      open Core#Std.Common
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   they're making a mistake.  I'd like to avoid this error, and I don't
</I>&gt;<i>   know really what the objection to the feature is, but in the worst
</I>&gt;<i>   case, we can add a syntax extension to work around this problem,
</I>&gt;<i>   using a -ppx transformer to add the open ourselves.
</I>
I'd like to add a suggestion  for the last last two requirements, from an OCaml user's perspective (i.e. not a platform/platform library implementor).
I don't feel too strongly about what the exact syntax or build system requirements are for namespaces, its just a suggestion.

core/std/common.mli:
namespace Core#Std
(* define a module Common in the Core#Std namespace.
 *  Effect: rename module to Core#Std.Common in the .cmi *)
....

core/std/common.ml:
namespace Core#Std
(* define a module Common in the Core#Std namespace.
 *  Effect: rename module to Core#Std.Common in the .cmi *)
....

Optionally one could also specify -root &lt;path&gt; on the cmdline to automatically create a namespace based on directory hierarchy.
If both are specified its checked that they are equal, and if not an error is shown.

core.mli:
namespace Std = struct
  module Core#Std.Common (* defines that this module is part of the namespace *)
  module Core#SomethingElse.SomeOtherModule
  open Core#Std.Common
  (* defines the Core#Std namespace in the .cmi, and the list of default opens to Core#Std.Common *)
  (* each namespace must have a .cmi named after its toplevel name
end


file_using_core.ml:
open Core#Std (* this opens the Core#Std namespace, and the Core#Std.Common module *)
(* Core#Std is of type 'namespace', so the compiler would know you open a namespace without having to explicitly say so with a keyword *)

(* you could even write *)
open Core (* opens Core namespace *)
open Std.Common (* opens Core#Std.Common module *)

namespace aliasing, and toplevel use:
&gt;<i> namespace Foo = Core#Std
</I>namespace Foo = &lt;
  module Core#Std.Common: sig .... end
  module Core#Std.SomeModule: sig .... end
   ... all modules ...
  open Core#Std.Common

How to find the module Foo#Bar.M:
 when searching for .cmi files:
   look for foo.cmi, and check namespace definitions inside
 when searching for .cmx/.cmo files (this is not optimal!):
   look for m.cmx/m.cmo, and check that full module name is good, skip to next in search path if not
 when searching for .cmxa/.cma files:
   look for a foo.cmxa/foo.cma -&gt; defines all modules for namespace Foo.
At link time only the modules that are actually used are kept (since opening a namespace doesn't have side-effects, unused namespaces/modules can be thrown away).

Best regards,
