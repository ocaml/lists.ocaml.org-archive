&gt;<i> Modules are namespaces !
</I>
I think that this assertion is misleading (and wrong), as it confuses the
word &quot;namespaces&quot; that refers to a specific proposal that could be called
&quot;foo&quot; and the intuitive meaning of namespaces that refers to expression
&quot;name management&quot;.  In the later sense, yes modules are doing some form of name
management. But in the former sense, no, modules are not doing the same kind
of name management as foo (namespaces).

&gt;<i>    They are containers for names and two identical names in two different
</I>&gt;<i>    modules are not deemed equal, that defines a namespace for me. A good
</I>&gt;<i>    deal of the module system is about managing names and their
</I>&gt;<i>    dissemination in the program. Modules are, however, as Yaron points
</I>&gt;<i>    out, much more than that.
</I>
Yes, there are similarities:

  - modules manage _internal_ names: names of values, names of types, and
    names of submodules.  They manage names of objects visible in the OCaml
    world.  They cannot speak about the outer world and of course not manage
    it.

  - namespaces manage names of toplevel modules, of collections of modules.
    They connect the outer world (files in the environment) with the inner
    world of OCaml, but cannot see the the world of OCaml. Modules are
    atomic/opaque objects for namespaces.

So they are similarities, but already some significant differences when just
comparing them in terms of name manipulation.

Moreover, as you noticed, modules do a lot more, and do so simultaneously:
they manage types, generativity, consistency of imports, keep the objects
closed, etc.  Because of this additional invariants in module objects, there
are operations that modules cannot do with names that namespaces can do.
For instance, modules cannot insert a new submodule inside an existing
module, or pick a module from a submodule to and rebuild a new module from
the component outside of its original context/closure: this could break
types, abstraction, (and bindings!)---unless you change the way modules are
typechecked, e.g. using mixin modules to keep track of some internal
dependencies make a difference between before/after linking status.

Namespaces can do almost arbitrary manipulations of toplevel modules and
collection of modules, because they see modules as atomic/opaque objects and
cannot change them.  If namespaces mess up with module names the compiler
and linker may pick the wrong objects but it will catch up those mistakes
because module objects are checked against module objects independently of
the names that were used to pick them.

So the rigid name manipulation of modules with strong invariants combined
with the arbirtrary name manipulation of namespaces remains sound---and with
a clear semantics.

Modules are a very sophisticated concept (think of their meta-theory).
Namespaces are a very trivial concept (trivial tree manipulation).

The complexity of Modules + Namespaces is just the max of the two, that is
the complexity of Modules. Namespaces do not add complexity.

So, I think that the separation of concerns is quite healthly here.  Each
concept can do powerful but different sorts of things in its own world
and the combination remains simple, because they is a clear separation.

&gt;<i> Well my own *naturalism* leads me to believe that since a good part of
</I>&gt;<i> modules is about managing names and given their recursive definition
</I>&gt;<i> (modules can contain modules) I find it natural to try to use them at the
</I>&gt;<i> library level.
</I>
I am not sure what you mean by *naturalism*.  Keeping a minimal set of
orthogonal features is probably something to seek for in the design of a
programming language.

So if namespaces were modules, they should not be added, but they are
an orthogonal concept.

If you wished to mix the power of modules and namespaces together as a
single concept, you probably need something like mixin modules (that can
reason about open modules and linking) whose metatheory is even harder than
that of modules plus an additional mechanism to be able to keep track in
mixins of which components can be stripped off at link time.

So *minimalism* in this situation is probably to keep two separate concepts.
At least, this is feasible in the short term.  The mixin approach may
perhaps be superior in the long term, but it cannot be a short term goal.

Besides, namespaces is not a new concept. They already exists in OCaml in a
trivial way, via the canonical mapping of the external file name in which a
module and its interface are implemented and the internal OCaml name of the
module object, plus the search path in which OCaml looks for module objects
to build its initial namespace.

This design choice was an excellent choice in the early days of OCaml when
applications were small and the focus was more on the power of the module
language than on dealing with a large industrial community of users.

Today, this choice shows its limitations.

The proposal is just to relax this rigid rule for building the initial
namespace (i.e. mapping from external file names to internal module
objects).  At the same time, using a tree-like structure rather than a flat
structure would allow for even more flexibility, but conceptually, it is not
significantly different from the flat map.
