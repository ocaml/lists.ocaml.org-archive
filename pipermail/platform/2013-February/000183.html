I sympathize with where Sylvain was going with that, though. To learn from
the experiences of serious users of OCaml, you've gotta put something in
their hands. OPAM's 'alpha' period was a great example of shipping early
(clearly with a lot of rough edges) and iterating on it quickly - I hope
you can stick to that model.

So I'd join Sylvain in hoping to see more details/discussion ASAP about
what constitutes the 'minimum viable product' for platform, v1. If we had a
specific backlog like that, it would help people like me know how to
contribute.
