opam show documentation says:
"

   The information block consists of the name of the package, the
       installed version if this package is installed in the currently
       selected compiler,.."

I have a switch BUILDSYSTEM that does not contain lwt.
1) it's not under ~/.opam/BUILDSYSTEM/lib
2) linking with the package lwt in this switch does not work.
Still "opam show lwt" does give me a version as in it's output:
>>>
opam show lwt
             package: lwt
             version: 2.6.0
...
>>>
ocaml show where lwt does show this:
>>>
opam show --where lwt
/home/immanuel/.opam/repo/default/packages/lwt/lwt.2.6.0/opam
>>>
I do have it installed in other switches.

Are my expectations wrong, or is this a bug?
Thanks in advance,
Immanuel

You should look at the `installed-versions` field. The `version` field is the version of the package used to gather the metadata. The package metadata exist even if you haven't the package installed.

Best,

This is indeed unclear, and has been already improved in the 2.0 alpha 
builds: the output is now separated in two sections, showing that the 
details printed are specific to a given version (chosen from installed 
or latest):

     $ opam show lwt

     =-=- lwt: information on all versions 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     name                   lwt
     all-installed-versions 2.4.8 [4.02.1 4.01.0+ocp1-20150202]  2.5.2 
[system 4.02.3 4.04]
                            2.6.0 [4.03.0]
     all-versions           2.3.2  2.4.0  2.4.1  2.4.2  2.4.3  2.4.4  
2.4.5  2.4.6  2.4.7  2.4.8
                            2.5.0  2.5.1  2.5.2  2.6.0

     =-=- Version-specific details 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     version       2.6.0
     repository    default
     url.src:      https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/archive/2.6.0.tar.gz
     [etc]

`--where` only show where the metadata was found, it doesn't relate to 
the contents of the package itself. `opam list` is the right tool if you 
want just to check whether the package is installed.

using "spreadgenerator.6.0.0.1" instead should work!

query operations are known to be somewhat lacking in 1.2.2 and have been 
thoroughly improved for the upcoming 2.0 version.
