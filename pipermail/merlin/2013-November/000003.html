<PRE>Hello,

I will be more than happy to help you on the second point to integrate
an external process that can ask directly oasis to generate a
configuration. I can help you on this project and even help you write
the extension.

Regards
Sylvain

&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There have been some changes recently on merlin's configuration, and
</I>&gt;<i> we're also considering some more heavy changes on the syntax for the
</I>&gt;<i> .merlin file.  We'd like to have people's input on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * * *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First we've added two new &quot;directives&quot;: CMT and CMI, these are
</I>&gt;<i> refinements of the &quot;B&quot; directive, which was used to add directories to
</I>&gt;<i> the build path. The need for this is primarily felt at JaneStreet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At janestreet, there is one big repository including, among others,
</I>&gt;<i> core and async.  Every source directory is also a build directory but
</I>&gt;<i> the cmi for packed modules are afterwards copied to a particular lib/
</I>&gt;<i> directory at the root of this repo.
</I>&gt;<i> You then have two options to set-up your build path in merlin: add
</I>&gt;<i> only lib/, or add every source directory.
</I>&gt;<i> The first option is unsatisfactory since you won't have access to cmt
</I>&gt;<i> files (that implies no fancy source browsing), but the second is also
</I>&gt;<i> problematic.  Indeed there is a lot of module name conflicts, and
</I>&gt;<i> there's no predictable way to tell which one will be choosen. That
</I>&gt;<i> results in the frequent presence of the error message &quot;Module Foo and
</I>&gt;<i> Bar make inconsistent assumptions over interface Baz&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the new directives, one can now add lib/ to the &quot;CMI&quot; dirs (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> the buildpath) and every other directory to the &quot;CMT&quot; dirs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On simpler setups, one can of course still simply use &quot;B&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NB: This is not on the opam package yet, only on the git repository.
</I>&gt;<i> We should however make a new release soon (in the next two weeks I'd
</I>&gt;<i> say).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * * *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are considering moving to a more expressive syntax for the .merlin
</I>&gt;<i> files, the goal is to be more precise about which files/directories
</I>&gt;<i> require which packages/compiler flags and which do not.
</I>&gt;<i> There is two different paths we can follow here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The first one is to adopt the syntax ocamlbuild uses in its _tags
</I>&gt;<i> file. This should be precise enough to express everything one would
</I>&gt;<i> ever need. Also it has the advantage of being a syntax everyone
</I>&gt;<i> already knows, and one can also imagine that at some point in the
</I>&gt;<i> future, merlin would be able to understand (at least partially) _tags
</I>&gt;<i> files whenever there is no .merlin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The second one, a bit more ambitious, consist of finding a way to
</I>&gt;<i> delegate the work to external tools. That is: merlin would call an
</I>&gt;<i> (arbitrary) external process, giving it the path of the file currently
</I>&gt;<i> under edition. And that process would then output merlin's
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> That way, people could first have the configuration file in their
</I>&gt;<i> language of choice, or call a tool to generate a configuration from an
</I>&gt;<i> _tags, _oasis, ?, but would also be able to have merlin integrated in
</I>&gt;<i> their build process. For example people using a build system running
</I>&gt;<i> in &quot;daemon&quot; mode (jenga, OMake) could then feed it the path of the
</I>&gt;<i> file being edited, and would then receive a list of the dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> of that file, as well as compiler flags required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would like to know if you think either of this approach is useful,
</I>&gt;<i> or interesting... or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * * *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frederic and Thomas.
