Subject: [Merlin] Repository moved to ocaml/ org on GitHub
Message-ID: <899C3227-8100-4598-862B-2213FEFB6DDB@recoil.org>

Dear all,

The Merlin source repository has moved to:

https://github.com/ocaml/merlin

There is a redirect in place from the old site, so you should notice any
difference aside from the new URL. If there are any access problems,
please let me know.

regards,
Anil
