<PRE>Dear Caml-list,

After the gestation period of a respectably sized whale, we are
pleased to announce the immediate availability of Real World OCaml.
It can be freely read online under a Creative Commons license:

<A HREF="https://realworldocaml.org/">https://realworldocaml.org/</A>

The book is also available from O'Reilly as a print/eBook edition:

<A HREF="http://oreil.ly/realworldOCaml">http://oreil.ly/realworldOCaml</A>

And also from Amazon, iBooks and the other usual book retailers.
If you enjoy it (or indeed, have criticisms), we'd welcome comments
and reviews on the various sites to help guide our efforts.
Purchasing a copy will help drive future editions and language
translations.

Real World OCaml development doesn't end here.  We've got exciting
features in the pipeline such as collaborative exercises using
js_of_ocaml to facilitate easier teaching, and various chapters
that didn't make the final book that we're planning to place online
after some editing work.

For now though, it's time to raise a glass to the fantastic community
effort that made this possible -- over 2400 (high quality) comments
in the end, and significant textual contributions from Leo White,
Jeremy Yallop, Stephen Weeks, tooling help around OPAM and UTop
from Thomas Gazagnaire, Jeremie Diminio, Louis Gesbert and his
colleagues at OCamlPro, and the constant advice from the entire
core development team led by Xavier Leroy (special thanks to Jacques
Garrigue for working hard to get the short-paths feature into OCaml
4.01).

best,
Anil, Yaron and Jason.
</PRE>
