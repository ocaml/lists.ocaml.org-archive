<PRE>The second and final public beta of Real World OCaml is now available:
 &lt;<A HREF="https://realworldocaml.org">https://realworldocaml.org</A>&gt;

Release notes:

* Over 2,000 comments from proofreaders have been resolved.  We realize that
 reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited
 feedback!  The book is now a week away from being handed over to the
 O'Reilly production team for copyediting, so the window for changes are
 limited after that.  Comments reset between milestones and so beta2 is a
 clean slate; we're still working through some remaining older issues.

* The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects
 and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to
 Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.

* All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated.
 The source code is as close to public domain as practical, at:
     &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples">https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples</A>&gt;

* The final version will have the installation chapter moved to be online
 only, and we intend to publish updates there to elaborate on installation
 and packaging mechanisms.

* Exercises will be available after we go into production, and also only be
 available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenting
 system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our readers
 on an ongoing basis.
