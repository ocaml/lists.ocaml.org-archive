Subject: [rwo-reviewers] Alpha6 available
Message-ID: <21C41A02-066E-4F39-81DB-E3C0AB6F23FF@recoil.org>

Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 6 milestone is now available online in HTML and PDF formats at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha 6 is the final alpha and has a completed Part III, with details on the runtime system, garbage collector and compiler toolchain.  It also contains a new Foreign Function Interface that doesn't require writing any C code to bind to other libraries.

Parts I and II have also seen some fairly significant revisions from the 1250 comments we've gathered from you and our editor Andy Oram.  

At this stage, we would particularly appreciated feedback on Part III chapters, as they have received less attention as they have landed later than the rest of the book.  This is the final alpha milestone, and a public beta will follow shortly.


best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil

The public beta is now out!  Further announcements will still be forwarded to
this list, as many of you are probably not the main OCaml list.

> Yaron Minsky, Jason Hickey and I are pleased to announce the beta release of
> our forthcoming O'Reilly book, called "Real World OCaml", available online at
> http://realworldocaml.org
> 
> The book is split into three parts: language concepts, tools and techniques,
> and understanding the runtime.  As promised last year, we are making a public
> beta available for community review and to help us hunt down inaccuracies and
> find areas that need more clarification.
> 
> We've had the book in closed alpha for six months or so and have developed a
> feedback system that uses Github to record your comments. This lets us follow
> up to each review with clarifications and keep track of our progress in fixing
> issues.  During alpha, we've received over 1400 comments in this fashion (and
> addressed the vast majority of them!).  However, since we anticipate more
> comments coming in from a public beta, we would request that you read the FAQ
> to avoid drowning us in repeat comments: http://www.realworldocaml.org/#faq
> 
> (TL;DR followup another comment on Github directly if you can instead of
> creating a new issue via the web interface)
> 
> This release is available in HTML format online at:
>   http://www.realworldocaml.org
> 
> O'Reilly is currently preparing a Rough Cuts release that will make the beta
> available as PDF and in popular eBook formats.   We anticipate that this will
> be available later this week, and I'll send a followup when that happens.
> 
> Finally, we would especially like to thank our alpha reviewers.  Their feedback
> (https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues) has been invaluable to the
> beta release. The book also includes substantial contributions to individual
> chapters from Jeremy Yallop (FFI), Stephen Weeks (GC) and Leo White (objects).
> 
> If you have any comments that you'd like to send directly by e-mail, please
> contact us at rwo-authors at recoil.org.
> 
> Release notes for beta1:
> 
> * The first-class modules chapter is incomplete, pending some portability
>  improvements to the ocaml-plugins Core library.
> * The binary serialization chapter is also incomplete, but has just enough
>  to teach you about the Async RPC library.
> * The installation chapter will be revised in anticipation of the OCaml 4.1
>  release, and is currently quite source-based.
> * The packaging and build systems chapter hasn't been started yet.  We're
>  still deciding whether or not to make this an online pointer rather than
>  a print chapter, since it's likely to change quite fast.
> * We are preparing exercises per chapter that are not included in this
>  particular beta release, but will be available online as soon as possible.
> * The code examples will all be clonable as a separate repository in beta2.
