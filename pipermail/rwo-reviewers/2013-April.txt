Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 4 milestone is now available online at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha4 completes Part I with the exception of the pattern matching chapter, and adds several new sections to Part II (JSON and the Command library) and Part III (half-finished runtime and garbage collection chapters).   Over 500 of your review comments have been addressed in this milestone, and our thanks for the excellent feedback to date.

We have changed our release scripts to stub out incomplete chapters instead of omitting them, which lets you see the structure of the overall book better (there are still some missing chapters, however).  This means that a PDF snapshot is also available via the website.  Although we prefer comments via the online system, if you find it more convenient to read it offline and scribble down notes, that's fine too.

We're aiming for the Async programming and runtime/garbage collection sections to be complete by the next milestone in a couple of weeks.

best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil

A request for reviewers: if you add a github comment that you later
realize is unnecessary or obsoleted somehow, it's better to close or
amend the initial issue, rather than create a new comment that
indicates that the old comment is obsolete.

We tend to go through the issues one by one in the github issue
tracker, not by reading them from the issue links in the text.  In
that mode, it's much easier if obsolete issues are simply closed.

I can understand why there may be some confusion about this.

Just to clarify, each individual 'comment' a reviewer makes on realworldocaml.org is turned into a *new* issue on GitHub.  (In that sense, I find it easier to think of each new comment as a starting a new thread)

If you're not sure what comments/issues you've created so far, you can visit the issue tracker [1] and click on "Created by you" to filter the list.
