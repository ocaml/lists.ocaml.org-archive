Message-ID: <7D93BD73-FC2E-4354-A6DA-98F3C67A9DCF@recoil.org>

Dear RWO reviewer,

Jason, Yaron and I have cut a new alpha milestone of Real World OCaml, available at:
http://www.realworldocaml.org/alpha3/en/html/

Significant changes since the previous alpha:

- New preface and installation appendix giving more context about how the book should be read.
- Modules and functors chapters much more consistent.
- New object-oriented and imperative programming chapters.
- Over 200 comments addressed in Part I.  Keep them coming!

Part II (practical examples) and Part III (advanced topics) are *not* fully included in this milestone, and we request reviewers focus on the first part (although comments on the later half of the book are also of course welcome).

The plan for alpha4 in ~2 weeks (in addition to resolving your comments on alpha3) is to have a more complete Part II, and also to have chapters for the remaining structure of the book in place (although not fully complete).  This will let us also issue a PDF version (right now, the O'Reilly build process complains due to missing cross-references).

best regards,
Anil
