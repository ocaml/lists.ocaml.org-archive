Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 5 milestone is now available online in HTML and PDF formats at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha 5 has a completed Part I with the Lists and Pattern Matching chapters now included. Part II now has several new chapters, with the most major being the asynchronous programming tutorial and parsing with Menhir.  There is a preview of the new FFI chapter in Part III, and additional work on the runtime sections. 

Over 1000 comments from reviewers have also been addressed in this milestone, so thank you very much for all the feedback so far! The next release after alpha5 will be a chapter-complete beta milestone in early June, followed by a full editing pass for text and grammatical consistency after that.  We will also publish a code repository with the examples in the book in time for the beta milestone.

At this stage, we would like more feedback on Part II chapters.

best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil
