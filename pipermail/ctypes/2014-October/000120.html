Yes, that's exactly right.

It's the latter.  Your callback function

    let cb fs = Printf.printf &quot;XXX Called '%s'\n&quot; (getf !@fs C._path) in

doesn't reference anything from the local environment, so no closure
is allocated, and there's nothing for the GC to collect.  If you
change the function to reference the local environment -- for example,
by adding a dummy use of 'data'

    let cb fs =
       let _ = Obj.repr data in
       Printf.printf &quot;XXX Called '%s'\n&quot; (getf !@fs C._path) in

then the test fails with CallToExpiredClosure as expected.  Besides
inspecting the source of the function, you can check whether a closure
is allocated by attempting to add a finaliser to the function, which
will fail for non-closures, or by inspecting the generated cmm (using
-dcmm), which looks like this for the non-closure case

      (let
        (cb/1325 &quot;camlTest_lifecycle__17&quot;

(i.e. cb is just a reference to a static function), and like this for
the closure case:

      (let
        (cb/1325 (alloc 3319 &quot;camlTest_lifecycle__cb_1325&quot; 3 data/1324)

I hope that helps,

Jeremy.
