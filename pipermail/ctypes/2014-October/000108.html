That approach should work, I think.

Another possibility to allocate the struct using Ctypes.allocate or
Ctypes.allocate_n -- e.g. by allocating an array of char and coercing
the result:

    val allocate : ?finalise:('a ptr -&gt; unit) -&gt; 'a typ -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a ptr
    <A HREF="http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALallocate">http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALallocate</A>

    val allocate_n : ?finalise:('a ptr -&gt; unit) -&gt; 'a typ -&gt; count:int -&gt; 'a ptr
    <A HREF="http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALallocate_n">http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALallocate_n</A>

    val coerce : 'a typ -&gt; 'b typ -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b
    <A HREF="http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALcoerce">http://ocamllabs.github.io/ocaml-ctypes/Ctypes.html#VALcoerce</A>

The memory allocated by 'allocate' will be freed automatically when
there are no OCaml references to the object.  The optional 'finalise'
argument is for associating additional cleanup functions, not for
freeing the memory.  You may be able to use it to call uv_loop_close,
for example.

&gt;<i> Aside: I wonder if ctypes could be extended to deal with this cross platform
</I>&gt;<i> issue fully in ctypes-land? Have others thought about this?
</I>
Yes: we're planning to add support for obtaining struct layout from C,
much as generated functions stubs are checked against C declarations:

    <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues/62">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues/62</A>

The feature is taking a little while longer than anticipated to land,
unfortunately.

&gt;<i> Also: are the maintainers open to documentation contributions? I noticed
</I>&gt;<i> that a lot of these questions on the FAQ are currently unanswered. I would
</I>&gt;<i> be happy to throw a couple commits with documentation suggestions for the
</I>&gt;<i> problems that I am running into.
</I>
Yes: documentation contributions are very welcome.
