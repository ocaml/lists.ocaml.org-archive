Thanks!  We're very glad to hear of your success.

I think this is something that ctypes can handle.  The trickiest part
is likely to be the memory management: when you pass an OCaml object
to C you need to be careful to ensure that the GC can still see it.
The inverted stubs support is still at an early stage, and in time I
think we'll develop techniques to make memory management easier.

On to the example.  If I understand correctly you'd like to build an
interface that looks something like this:

   struct callbacks {
      int (*arith)(int, int);
      int (*print)(char *);
   };

   struct callbacks *build(int id);

Here's how to build a library with the above interface using ctypes.
First, a definition for the struct:

   (* bindings.ml *)
   open Ctypes

   let callbacks : [`callback] structure typ = structure &quot;callbacks&quot;
   let arith = field callbacks &quot;arith&quot;
                       (Foreign.funptr (int @-&gt; int @-&gt; returning int))
   let print = field callbacks &quot;print&quot;
                       (Foreign.funptr (string @-&gt; returning void))
   let () = seal callbacks

For this example I'll use the simplest possible memory management
strategy: a cache which holds references to OCaml values returned from
the 'build' function:

   type state = { arith: int -&gt; int -&gt; int; print: string -&gt; unit }
   let cache : ([`callback] structure  * state) list ref = ref []

The build function itself allocates and initializes a struct, adds it
to the cache, and returns it:

   let build id =
     let state = { arith = (+);
                   print = Printf.printf &quot;id: %d; msg: %s\n%!&quot; id } in
     let c = make callbacks in
     begin
       setf c arith state.arith;
       setf c print state.print;
       cache := (c, state) :: !cache;
       addr c
     end

The external interface is described with a functor in the usual way.
We expose a single function, &quot;build&quot;, by passing name, type, and
implementation to the &quot;internal&quot; function.

    module Bindings(I: Cstubs_inverted.INTERNAL) =
    struct
      let _ = I.internal &quot;build&quot; (int @-&gt; returning (ptr callbacks)) build
    end

I won't post all the build details here, but I've put them in a gist
so that you can compile and run the example.

   <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/yallop/d196fee1607883493876">https://gist.github.com/yallop/d196fee1607883493876</A>

It's worth just showing a use of the library here.  Here's a little test client:

   #include &quot;callback_stubs.h&quot;
   #include &lt;caml/callback.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
     /* Initialize the OCaml runtime before calling the library. */
     char *caml_argv[1] = { NULL };
     caml_startup(caml_argv);

     struct callbacks *c0 = build(0);
     struct callbacks *c1 = build(1);

     printf(&quot;c0-&gt;arith(10, 20) =&gt; %d\n&quot;, c0-&gt;arith(10, 20));
     printf(&quot;c1-&gt;arith(30, 40) =&gt; %d\n&quot;, c0-&gt;arith(30, 40));
     c0-&gt;print(&quot;printing via c0&quot;);
     c1-&gt;print(&quot;printing via c1&quot;);

     return 0;
   }

The output is as you'd expect:

   c0-&gt;arith(10, 20) =&gt; 30
   c1-&gt;arith(30, 40) =&gt; 70
   id: 0; msg: printing via c0
   id: 1; msg: printing via c1

I hope that helps,

Jeremy.
