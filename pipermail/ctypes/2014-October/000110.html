</I>&gt;<i>        x
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And then run your application with valgrind. Valgrind did find

</I>&gt;<i>     (<A HREF="https://github.com/hcarty/ocaml-gdal/pull/3">https://github.com/hcarty/ocaml-gdal/pull/3</A>)
</I>
To follow up on the specifics for this case: A finalization/free
function provided by GDAL was freeing memory I had allocated from
ctypes leading to a double free.  As A. Hauptmann pointed out in the
pull request link above, valgrind picked up the mistake and its source
immediately.  For this crash removing the GDAL-provided finalization
function was enough to avoid the issue - OCaml + ctypes were already
freeing everything the finalizer would have freed.

I'm rather embarrassed that I didn't use valgrind in the first place.
Thanks to A Hauptmann for getting me back on track with these
bindings.
