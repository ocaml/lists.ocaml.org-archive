While this approach works to some extent, it's not recommended.  The
unix_mkdir function accepts and returns 'value' values, not strings
and ints:

   value unix_mkdir(value path, value perm)
   <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/98e0051f/otherlibs/unix/mkdir.c#L21">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/98e0051f/otherlibs/unix/mkdir.c#L21</A>

Now, an OCaml string stored in a 'value' is represented similarly to a
C string -- i.e. as a pointer to the first byte of an array of char --
so some C functions that accept a 'value' will work as you expect when
you pass then a string using ctypes.  However, you're likely to run
into unexpected behaviour very quickly:

   # let string_length = Foreign.foreign &quot;caml_string_length&quot;  (string
@-&gt; returning int);;
   val string_length : string -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
   # string_length &quot;abc&quot;;;
   - : int = -1

There's good news, though: the Unix stubs in the standard library are
only thin wrappers around system calls, so you won't lose much by
binding to the system calls directly.  Further, David Sheets has
already written ctypes bindings to some of the functions you need; his
bindings don't currently accept null pointers, but you may be able to
adapt them to your needs:
