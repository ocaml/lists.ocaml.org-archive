OCaml-Java support is on the wish list for ctypes

    <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues/13">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/issues/13</A>

but we don't have the resources to implement it at present.  Adding
support would mostly likely only involve changing ctypes itself, not
OCaml-Java, and is likely to involve writing OCaml-Java
implementations of the following components:

  (1) memory access, i.e. functions for allocating blocks, for reading
and writing scalar values to arbitrary addresses, and for viewing C
objects as bigarrays:
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/memory_stubs.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/memory_stubs.ml</A>
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/bigarray_stubs.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/bigarray_stubs.ml</A>

  (2) functions for printing primitive (scalar) values:
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/value_printing_stubs.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/value_printing_stubs.ml</A>

  (3) implementations of signed and unsigned integer types of various sizes:
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/signed.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/signed.ml</A>
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/unsigned.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/unsigned.ml</A>

  (4) functions for converting between OCaml and C string representations
     <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/std_view_stubs.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes/std_view_stubs.ml</A>

plus one of the following approaches for calling functions

  (a) a &quot;dynamic&quot; approach, which resolves symbols and constructs call
frames at runtime, like the ctypes Foreign module.  This involves two
components: a dynamic loading interface along the
      following lines
      <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes-foreign-base/dl.mli">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes-foreign-base/dl.mli</A>
      and primitives for dynamically constructing and making calls:
      <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes-foreign-base/ffi_stubs.ml">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/ctypes-foreign-base/ffi_stubs.ml</A>

  (b) a &quot;static&quot; approach, which generates code to be compiled by the
standard toolchain:
      <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/cstubs/cstubs.mli">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/master/src/cstubs/cstubs.mli</A>

Note that most of the links above are to internal Ctypes modules, not
to the interface, which I'd expect to remain largely unchanged.

As Xavier suggests, JNA may be a good starting point for some or all
of the above.  If someone would like to look at adding OCaml-Java
support, please feel free to ask questions, either on the GitHub issue
tracker, or on the ctypes mailing list.

Jeremy.
