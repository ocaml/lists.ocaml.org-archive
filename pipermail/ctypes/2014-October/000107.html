<PRE>Daniel,

Your suggestion makes sense. If I were to do that -- any suggestions of how
to deal with freeing that memory? Ideally, without adding a lifecycle
&quot;free&quot; call to the user library. My thoughts would be to store the cstruct
reference (malloced by C) in a ref in OCaml, then attach a finalizer to the
OCaml ref that would call the corresponding C free. I suggest the ref
because my understanding is that his would be guaranteed to be finalized
once (as opposed to a normal value which might get copied multiple times).
Thoughts on this?

Aside: I wonder if ctypes could be extended to deal with this cross
platform issue fully in ctypes-land? Have others thought about this?

Also: are the maintainers open to documentation contributions? I noticed
that a lot of these questions on the FAQ are currently unanswered. I would
be happy to throw a couple commits with documentation suggestions for the
problems that I am running into.

Trevor
