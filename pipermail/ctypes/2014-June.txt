Subject: [ocaml-ctypes] Converting from int to file_descr
Message-ID: <CAATUEDK6JBKFqUq5xcj=yGhAnEVfHfRGbtJdKK45BtKT_xvXpw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to call forkpty
pid_t forkpty(int *amaster, char *name, const struct termios *termp, const
struct winsize *winp);

Only care about file descriptor 'amaster' and result : pid_t

All is good:
  let forkpty = foreign "forkpty" (ptr int @-> ptr void @-> ptr void @->
ptr void @-> returning int)

    let amaster : int ptr = allocate int -1 in
    let pid = forkpty amaster null null null in
    let pipefd = !@ amaster

Do not understand how to convert the int representing file descriptor to
 Unix.file_descr

Or use a view to pass a Unix.file_descr as an int to forkpty ?

Any help appreciated ...

Hi Costel,

I use the fd-send-recv package in opam for this coercion. The function
to use is Fd_send_recv.int_of_fd. You can easily create a ctypes view
for Unix.file_descr with

Ctypes.view ~read:Fd_send_recv.fd_of_int ~write:Fd_send_recv.int_of_fd
Ctypes.int

Internally, file descriptors are just OCaml ints as you can see from
<https://github.com/djs55/ocaml-fd-send-recv/blob/master/lib/fd_send_recv.ml#L22>.
Because of this, you could also easily implement this coercion
yourself. I prefer to adopt the tiny fd-send-recv dependency and
abstract this dirty Obj.magic business.

Hope this helps,

David Sheets

I notice that Stephane Glondu (CCed) kindly uploaded Ctypes 0.2.3 into Debian; 
https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/libctypes-ocaml

I'm not sure what the process for keeping you informed of releases is, but there's a Ctypes 0.3.0 release now that supports C stub generation, and would be good to get into distributions  as well.
