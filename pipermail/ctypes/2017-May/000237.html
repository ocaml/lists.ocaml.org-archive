</I>
Yes.  The only way to prevent a value from being collected is to
ensure that it's visible to the GC, which requires keeping a reference
to it in an OCaml object.  The GC doesn't scan C memory, such as
struct fields, so storing a function in a struct field won't stop it
being collected.

&gt;<i> -what may cause CallToExpiredClosure raise too if I has only one callback to
</I>&gt;<i> call and at C side this struct in GDB seems to be correct?
</I>
If there's an OCaml reference to the function passed to C then
CallToExpiredClosure should never occur.  But it has to be exactly the
same function -- for example, storing a function in a struct field,
then reading from the struct field will create a new copy of the
function, which won't prevent the original from being collected.

If you have a (smallish) running example somewhere of the code that's
causing problems I'd be happy to take a look.

Kind regards,

Jeremy.
