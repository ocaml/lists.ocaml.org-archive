Sure: there are different opinions on this, but I agree that a test
for null would be reasonable here.

It's better in general to use Ctypes.ptr_compare, since ptr is an
abstract type and the values contain extra data besides the raw
address.  (I think polymorphic equality will do what you expect for
the special case of comparing to Ctypes.null, but in general you can
have two Ctypes.ptr values referencing the same object but not
considered equal by =.)

Even better, if your pointers are nullable you might use
Ctypes.ptr_opt to construct them, and pattern matching against
Some/None to check for null.

&gt;<i> Regarding my other use case, what I miss is a way to tag a view (with
</I>&gt;<i> the identity coercion both way) with a name, and be able to use that
</I>&gt;<i> name to pick the right pretty printer (for flags, and so on). That

</I>
It'd be convenient to have a way to add custom value printers for
views, along similar lines to the format_typ optional argument to the
view function.  I think that would actually solve both your problems
neatly: you could have a view with a custom printer for your flags
which turned integers into symbolic names, and a view with a custom
printer for your pointer-to-struct arguments which printed out the
pointed-to values rather than the addresses.  Pull requests welcome!
(or feel free to raise an issue, if you prefer).
