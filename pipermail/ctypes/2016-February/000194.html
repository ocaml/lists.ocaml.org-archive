<PRE>Dear Malcolm,

On 28/02/2016, Malcolm Matalka &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/ctypes">mmatalka at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>
The best approach is to use the Cstubs_structs module, which allows
you to declare just the parts of the structs that you need to access
in your program, and which generates code that uses the C struct
declarations to work out sizes, alignments, field offsets, etc.  The
basic API is the familiar set of functions &quot;structure&quot;, &quot;field&quot; and
&quot;seal&quot; from the Ctypes module, but the build process is a little more
involved.  However, in return for the more complex build, all the
issues that you're concerned about are addressed.

The Cstubs_structs API is not yet very well documented, but there's a
brief guide with examples in the pull request that introduced it:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/62">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/62</A>

&gt;<i> Some concerns I have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - It seems fragile - a different version of the library might have
</I>&gt;<i>   different members in the struct so keeping my ocaml code in-synch
</I>&gt;<i>   seems error prone.
</I>
The Cstubs_structs module addresses this by using generated C code to
determine the offsets of fields each time you build your library.

&gt;<i> - It's annoying because the struct has a lot of members I don't care
</I>&gt;<i>   about in my case.  I only want access to a few members that have
</I>&gt;<i>   important details.
</I>
Since Cstubs_structs retrieves layout rather than computing it you
only need to declare the members that you care about.

&gt;<i> - The struct is large with lots of types that I don't necessarily want
</I>&gt;<i>   to create so creating the struct becomes somewhat awkward.  If I know
</I>&gt;<i>   the size of the types I might be able to pretend it's an array of N
</I>&gt;<i>   chars or something instead of trying to implement the type just to
</I>&gt;<i>   fill out this struct, but I don't know if that is valid.
</I>
Again, since Cstubs_structs retrieves struct layout and alignment
information from C, you can use Ctypes.make to create struct values,
even if you haven't declared all the fields.

Kind regards,

Jeremy.
