</I>&gt;<i> issues that you're concerned about are addressed.

Great, with some small modifications this worked like a charm.


&gt;&gt;<i> Some concerns I have:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - It seems fragile - a different version of the library might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   different members in the struct so keeping my ocaml code in-synch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   seems error prone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Cstubs_structs module addresses this by using generated C code to
</I>&gt;<i> determine the offsets of fields each time you build your library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - It's annoying because the struct has a lot of members I don't care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   about in my case.  I only want access to a few members that have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   important details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since Cstubs_structs retrieves layout rather than computing it you
</I>&gt;<i> only need to declare the members that you care about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The struct is large with lots of types that I don't necessarily want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   to create so creating the struct becomes somewhat awkward.  If I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the size of the types I might be able to pretend it's an array of N
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   chars or something instead of trying to implement the type just to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   fill out this struct, but I don't know if that is valid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, since Cstubs_structs retrieves struct layout and alignment
</I>&gt;<i> information from C, you can use Ctypes.make to create struct values,
</I>&gt;<i> even if you haven't declared all the fields.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremy.
