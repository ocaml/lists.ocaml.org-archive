<PRE>BTW: Just though I&#8217;d say, Ctypes is a pretty nice library.
Well done! There&#8217;s no such thing as a perfect foreign interface
to C, but Ctypes handles much of it reasonably well.
Indeed, even the &#8220;domestic&#8221; interface to C (using C from C
code) is pretty messy.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have another question: what&#8217;s the best way to bind an &#8220;enum&#8221;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the codes are sequential is there a builtin way to map the enum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into an Ocaml variant?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ctypes provides two functions for this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   'constant' retrieves the value of a compile-time constant
</I>&gt;<i> (enumeration constant, #define value, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://ocamllabs.io/ocaml-ctypes/Cstubs.Types.TYPE.html#VALconstant">http://ocamllabs.io/ocaml-ctypes/Cstubs.Types.TYPE.html#VALconstant</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   'enum' builds a 'typ' value from a mapping between constants and OCaml values
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://ocamllabs.io/ocaml-ctypes/Cstubs.Types.TYPE.html#VALenum">http://ocamllabs.io/ocaml-ctypes/Cstubs.Types.TYPE.html#VALenum</A>
</I>
Ah, thanks, I missed that.

Hmm. What does it mean when it says &#8220;the size and alignment are retrieved&#8221;??
The only way to do that would be to generate C code and measure it.

So this is Cstubs which IS used that way. But its a multi-step process I do not
wish to use.  At least for me at this stage .. too much magic:

<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5mmi7BBMY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5mmi7BBMY</A>

Looking at the yaml example, jbuilder is used with a ppx to do this at
during Ocaml compilation, is that correct?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ctypes_type.TYPE is an abstract interface to type descriptions.  The
</I>&gt;<i> Ctypes module gives a default implementation of the interface.  The
</I>&gt;<i> interface is also used elsewhere, though; in particular, it's used for
</I>&gt;<i> describing C types whose layout is retrieved from C:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/0.13.1/src/cstubs/cstubs.mli">https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/blob/0.13.1/src/cstubs/cstubs.mli</A>
</I>
Ah, ok, that makes sense.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, you can bind a struct using the 'structure' and 'field'
</I>&gt;<i> values in the TYPE interface:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   let s = structure &quot;s&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   let x  = field s &quot;x&quot; int
</I>&gt;<i>   ....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you use the implementations of 'structure' and 'field in the Ctypes
</I>&gt;<i> module then the struct layout is computed using an implementation that
</I>&gt;<i> computes offsets using the alignment information for each type.  But
</I>&gt;<i> if you use the implementations of 'structure' and 'field' from the
</I>&gt;<i> Cstubs module then the layout information is retrieved by generating C
</I>&gt;<i> code that's run through a C compiler.  The interface (i.e. TYPE) is
</I>&gt;<i> the same in both cases, but it's useful to have different
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of that interface.
</I>
Again, worth adding this description somewhere in the docs.
Not sure where though, it doesn&#8217;t fit into the &#8220;ocamldoc&#8221; generated
pages, more into an &#8220;overall design&#8221; doc.

Hmm. How can I contribute easily. Its too early for me to actually
write docs. However I could create an issue with copies of your
email comments for someone to integrate.

Also the Q&amp;A style here might suit Stackoverflow?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Current rules say Ocaml strings are immutable, use bytes instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if several threads are running, normally Ocaml is using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a global lock to serialise them. However the lock is normally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> released when calling C code. That would not be safe in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case, using ocaml_string, so presumably in this case the lock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not released. Is that correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's correct.  Ctypes supports releasing the lock (via the
</I>&gt;<i> ~release_runtime_lock argument in Foreign.foreign, or via the
</I>&gt;<i> concurrency policy in Cstubs), but the lock isn&#8217;t released by default.
</I>
Ah. That&#8217;s important info. Hmm. It is possible the client will be
using the binding which is of a high performance specialised
file transfer/analysis code with Jane St Async and might expect
operations to run &#8220;in the background&#8221; using a future. The C library
uses a thread pool, for example. I suspect this means the lock
would have to be released. Also  .. when .. or should that be &#8220;if?&#8221;
multi-core arrives it will create a big mess. (Especially for 
JS/Async :)
