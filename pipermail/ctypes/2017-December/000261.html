Thank you!  I appreciate the kind words.

&gt;&gt;<i>   'enum' builds a 'typ' value from a mapping between constants and OCaml values

</I>
Indeed, that's exactly what happens.  The C standard doesn't place
many constraints on the layout of enums, so there isn't really another
way of building enum types that's guaranteed to work.

&gt;<i> Looking at the yaml example, jbuilder is used with a ppx to do this at

</I>
I don't think there's a ppx involved, but there is a code generation
step (or, rather, a couple of code generation steps).

&gt;<i> Hmm. How can I contribute easily. Its too early for me to actually
</I>&gt;<i> write docs. However I could create an issue with copies of your
</I>&gt;<i> email comments for someone to integrate.
</I>
Issues suggesting improvements to the documentation are always welcome!

Kind regards,

Jeremy
