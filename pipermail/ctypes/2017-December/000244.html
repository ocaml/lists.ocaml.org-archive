<PRE>Jeremy, it appears you are right, as usual.

I've replace my type definition:

   type 'm connection = B.mysql

with

   type 'm connection =
     { handle : B.mysql
     ; host   : char Ctypes.ptr option
     ; port   : int
     ; user   : char Ctypes.ptr option
     ; pass   : char Ctypes.ptr option
     ; db     : char Ctypes.ptr option
     ; socket : char Ctypes.ptr option
     }

and that made the error disappear (initially the record only had a field 
for the user, which caused and error on the password, then on the db 
name, etc. which I guess confirms your diagnosis). The port is there 
only for completeness.

Tomorrow I'll make the fix in the real library code.

Regarding ocaml-memcpy, would it have the same effect in this case if I 
replaced the &quot;ptr_opt char&quot; parameters in the binding specifications 
with just &quot;string&quot;, thus letting ctypes make the copy? In that case, 
would I still need to keep a reference to the strings on the OCaml side?

Cheers, and thanks a lot,
Andre

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that the problem arises from the nonblocking nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> code.  When a program creates a block of memory using Ctypes.allocate,
</I>&gt;<i> like this
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      let user = allocate ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ctypes ensures the memory is not freed so long as 'user' is reachable.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, if 'user' is passed to a C function then ctypes ensures
</I>&gt;<i> that the memory is not freed for the duration of the function call.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, in the MariaDB bindings 'user' appears to be accessed by
</I>&gt;<i> MariaDB after the C function it's passed to returns.  More concretely,
</I>&gt;<i> the pointer is passed into C like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      let user = allocate ... in
</I>&gt;<i>      ...
</I>&gt;<i>      B.mysql_real_connect_start ret mysql host user pass db port socket flags
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and then mysql_real_connect_start keeps a reference to 'user' and
</I>&gt;<i> returns immediately.  Since OCaml/ctypes can no longer see any uses of
</I>&gt;<i> 'user', the memory is assumed to be no longer needed and so it's
</I>&gt;<i> reclaimed by the GC.  However, MariaDB still has a reference (that it
</I>&gt;<i> later accesses asynchronously) which is unsafe to use after the GC
</I>&gt;<i> reclaims the memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the above is correct then there are at least two solutions.  You
</I>&gt;<i> could ensure somehow that 'user' and other such pointers are kept
</I>&gt;<i> around on the OCaml side until the associated memory is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> needed by MariaDB.  Or you could switch from 'allocate' to a
</I>&gt;<i> malloc/free style arrangement to avoid the automatic collection
</I>&gt;<i> altogether.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a bit of guesswork involved in the above, so please follow up
</I>&gt;<i> if it doesn't fix the problem for you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jeremy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS You may find ocaml-memcpy (<A HREF="https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-memcpy">https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-memcpy</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> a useful alternative to char_ptr_buffer_of_string for copying strings
</I>&gt;<i> between OCaml and C memory.
