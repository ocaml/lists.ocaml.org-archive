Hello,

I'm posting here some code samples that helped me a lot, hoping they
could be of any help to somebody else. They were kindly provided by
Jeremy Yallop
(<A HREF="https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes-inverted-stubs-example/issues/11">https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes-inverted-stubs-example/issues/11</A>).

I have an OCaml function returning a string, and I wanted to deliver
this function through a shared library to be called by a foreign language.

My first naive try was to do something like this (see
<A HREF="https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes-inverted-stubs-example">https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-ctypes-inverted-stubs-example</A> for a
complete example of how to wrap OCaml code in a shared library):

```OCaml
let () = I.internal &quot;compute&quot; (string @-&gt; returning string)
MyLibrary.my_function
```

The problem with this solution is that the interface of the `compute`
function is:

```C
char* compute(char* x17);
```

There is no contract on how to free the memory after it has been used,
which is problematic.

Since I'm a bit lazy, instead of registering the string as a gc root,
and exposing a deallocation function to C, I decided to delegate all
the work (allocation/deallocation) to the client of my library. The
interface being something like:

```C
int compute(char * question, char * answer_buffer, size_t buffer_sz);
```

Jeremy proposed two solutions. The first one makes use of Bigarrays:

```OCaml
let compute question buffer buffer_sz =
  let int_sz = Unsigned.Size_t.to_int buffer_sz in
  let ba_buffer = Ctypes.(bigarray_of_ptr array1) int_sz Bigarray.char
buffer in
  let computed_size = ... in
  if computed_size &gt; int_sz then null
  else  ...
```

and the second one is based on Ctypes.CArray module:

```OCaml
let compute question buffer buffer_sz =
  let int_sz = Unsigned.Size_t.to_int buffer_sz in
  let ba_buffer = Ctypes.CArray.from_ptr buffer int_sz in
  let computed_size = ... in
  if computed_size &gt; int_sz then null
  else ...
```

I choosed the first approach with great success. Since my function is
to be called more than once, I choosed to have the client allocate two
buffers to be reused. 1 for the question, and another to be filled
with the answer:

```OCaml
(* char Ctypes.ptr -&gt; Unsigned.Size_t.t -&gt; char Ctypes.ptr -&gt;
Unsigned.Size_t.t -&gt; int *)
let calcul_buffers question question_sz buffer buffer_sz =

  let ans = string_from_ptr question ~length:(Unsigned.Size_t.to_int
question_sz)
                 |&gt; Calcback.traite in
  let ans_sz = Bytes.length ans in

  let int_buffer_sz = Unsigned.Size_t.to_int buffer_sz in
  let ba_buffer = Ctypes.(bigarray_of_ptr array1) int_buffer_sz
Bigarray.Char buffer in

  for i = 0 to pred (min int_buffer_sz ans_sz) do
    Bigarray.Array1.set ba_buffer i ans.[i]
  done;

  ans_sz
```

The returned `int` is the size needed to return the complete answer:
this is also the job of the client to increase the size of the buffer
if needed.

In order to avoid the for loop, I tried to wrap `(ans:string)` into a
Bigarray, in order to use a `blit` (I may be wrong, but I think it
ends as a memcopy, instead of a char by char copy).

The trick was to coerce the string into a `(ptr char)`.

```OCaml
let compute question question_sz buffer buffer_sz =
  let ans =
    string_from_ptr question ~length:(Unsigned.Size_t.to_int question_sz)
    |&gt; MyLibrary.my_function in
  let ans_sz = Bytes.length ans in

  let int_buffer_sz = Unsigned.Size_t.to_int buffer_sz in
  let size_transmitted = min int_buffer_sz ans_sz in

  Bigarray.Array1.blit
    (bigarray_of_ptr array1 size_transmitted Bigarray.char (coerce
string (ptr char) ans))
    (bigarray_of_ptr array1 size_transmitted Bigarray.Char buffer);

  ans_sz
```

Ctypes is really nice. And I thank Jeremy for his kind support.

Happy hacking.
