Subject: [ocaml-ctypes] ANN: ocaml-ctypes 0.6.0
Message-ID: <CAAxsn=F_r07UY+dOeTT3=02PKzGc7Hs2ZVyS6c4VkCFsa+46Lw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm pleased to announce release 0.6.0 of ocaml-ctypes, which is now available
on OPAM.

Besides several new features, this release introduces a number of
backwards-incompatible changes, which are described below.  If your code is
available on OPAM and is affected by these changes then you should have
received a pull request with a fix.  If you have questions about how to update
your code, please feel free to post to the list (ctypes at lists.ocaml.org).

== Selected new features in 0.5.0 ==

* The Cstubs.FOREIGN interface has been extended with 'returning' and '@->',
  and with some new types.

  See the pull request for details:
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/389

  NB: code that generates bindings using Cstubs may need to be updated to
  select return and @-> from the bindings functor argument rather than from
  the Ctypes module.  Code that needs to be updated will fail to compile with
  the new interface.  The pull request shows how to update your code, if
  necessary.

* The Cstubs module can now generate asynchronous bindings to C functions
  using the Lwt jobs framework.

  See the pull request for details:
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/391

* The Cstubs module now supports optionally returning errno alongside the
  return value of bound C functions.

  See the pull request for details:
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/392

* Cross-compilation support is improved: the configuration step no longer runs
  binaries on the host.

  See the pull request for details:
    https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/383

* The Unsigned.S interface has new 'of_int64' and 'to_int64' functions.

== Compatibility ==

Besides the changes to Cstubs.FOREIGN, ocaml-ctypes 0.6.0 introduces the
following backwards-incompatible changes:

* The deprecated '*:*' and '+:+' functions have been removed.  Use
  Ctypes.field instead.

* OCaml 4.00.* is no longer supported.  The earliest supported OCaml release
  is 4.01.0

== Thanks ==

I'm grateful to Spiros Eliopoulos, @orbitz, Leonid Rozenberg and Peter Zotov
for contributions to this release.
