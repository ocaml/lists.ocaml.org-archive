There's one thing I forgot to mention: it's important to ensure that
the function you assign to the global isn't garbage collected while
there's still a possibility that it can be called by the C library.
If you use a global function everything should be fine, and you don't
need to do anything special.  It's also fine to use a non-global
function such as a closure constructed at runtime, but you'll need to
keep a reference to it around in OCaml to prevent collection.

&gt;<i> There's one twist which still has me stumped though. For custom
</I>&gt;<i> completion functions, Readline requires an array be returned which is
</I>&gt;<i> null-terminated. As far as I can tell, it's impossible to represent this
</I>&gt;<i> within the OCaml type system. Is this something I'd have to dip into the
</I>&gt;<i> Obj module to implement? What would that look like?
</I>
Is it an array of pointers terminated with a null pointer?  The ctypes
array type can represent that; there's a function in the fts
binding[0] in the distribution that converts an OCaml list to such an
array which might be a useful inspiration or starting point.
