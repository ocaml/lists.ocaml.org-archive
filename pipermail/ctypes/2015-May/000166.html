Right.

</I>
It's not trivial, but it's certainly possible.  The async_ssl package
is a useful example to work from; it binds various constants in the
Ffi_bindings.types module:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/bindings/ffi_bindings.ml#L1-L40">https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/bindings/ffi_bindings.ml#L1-L40</A>

and uses ocamlbuild rules to set up the appropriate dependencies

   <A HREF="https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/myocamlbuild.ml">https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/myocamlbuild.ml</A>

There's also a bit of _oasis set-up to build the executables:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/_oasis#L84-L97">https://github.com/janestreet/async_ssl/blob/c58a80b7/_oasis#L84-L97</A>

I wonder if it'd be useful for the Ctypes package to include some
reusable ocamlbuild rules to make this kind of thing easier.

&gt;<i> My final bit of research landed me on an open Bountysource issue[6] on
</I>&gt;<i> which it looks like there's a plan to smooth this out to make the workflow more
</I>&gt;<i> like the stub generation for foreign function bindings:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can address both these concerns with an alternative workflow for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cstubs_structs.TYPE that follows the same pattern as stub generation for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions: generate C and ML directly from the functor containing your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bindings, then link the generated C and ML into your program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds fantastic! I was wondering if there is any branch of Ctypes with
</I>&gt;<i> this functionality yet that I could try out or if there is any expectation to
</I>&gt;<i> add this in the near-term?
</I>
I've just pushed a branch with an implementation of this proposal.

Feedback is very welcome!
