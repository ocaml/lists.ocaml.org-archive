Dear RWO reviewer,

Jason, Yaron and I have cut a new alpha milestone of Real World OCaml, =
available at:
http://www.realworldocaml.org/alpha3/en/html/

Significant changes since the previous alpha:

- New preface and installation appendix giving more context about how =
the book should be read.
- Modules and functors chapters much more consistent.
- New object-oriented and imperative programming chapters.
- Over 200 comments addressed in Part I.  Keep them coming!

Part II (practical examples) and Part III (advanced topics) are *not* =
fully included in this milestone, and we request reviewers focus on the =
first part (although comments on the later half of the book are also of =
course welcome).

The plan for alpha4 in ~2 weeks (in addition to resolving your comments =
on alpha3) is to have a more complete Part II, and also to have chapters =
for the remaining structure of the book in place (although not fully =
complete).  This will let us also issue a PDF version (right now, the =
O'Reilly build process complains due to missing cross-references).

best regards,
Anil=

Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 4 milestone is now available online at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha4 completes Part I with the exception of the pattern matching =
chapter, and adds several new sections to Part II (JSON and the Command =
library) and Part III (half-finished runtime and garbage collection =
chapters).   Over 500 of your review comments have been addressed in =
this milestone, and our thanks for the excellent feedback to date.

We have changed our release scripts to stub out incomplete chapters =
instead of omitting them, which lets you see the structure of the =
overall book better (there are still some missing chapters, however).  =
This means that a PDF snapshot is also available via the website.  =
Although we prefer comments via the online system, if you find it more =
convenient to read it offline and scribble down notes, that's fine too.

We're aiming for the Async programming and runtime/garbage collection =
sections to be complete by the next milestone in a couple of weeks.

best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil=

A request for reviewers: if you add a github comment that you later
realize is unnecessary or obsoleted somehow, it's better to close or
amend the initial issue, rather than create a new comment that
indicates that the old comment is obsolete.

We tend to go through the issues one by one in the github issue
tracker, not by reading them from the issue links in the text.  In
that mode, it's much easier if obsolete issues are simply closed.

I can understand why there may be some confusion about this.

Just to clarify, each individual 'comment' a reviewer makes on =
realworldocaml.org is turned into a *new* issue on GitHub.  (In that =
sense, I find it easier to think of each new comment as a starting a new =
thread)

If you're not sure what comments/issues you've created so far, you can =
visit the issue tracker [1] and click on "Created by you" to filter the =
list.

Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 5 milestone is now available online in HTML and PDF formats =
at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha 5 has a completed Part I with the Lists and Pattern Matching =
chapters now included. Part II now has several new chapters, with the =
most major being the asynchronous programming tutorial and parsing with =
Menhir.  There is a preview of the new FFI chapter in Part III, and =
additional work on the runtime sections.=20

Over 1000 comments from reviewers have also been addressed in this =
milestone, so thank you very much for all the feedback so far! The next =
release after alpha5 will be a chapter-complete beta milestone in early =
June, followed by a full editing pass for text and grammatical =
consistency after that.  We will also publish a code repository with the =
examples in the book in time for the beta milestone.

At this stage, we would like more feedback on Part II chapters.

best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil

Dear Real World OCaml reviewers,

The Alpha 6 milestone is now available online in HTML and PDF formats =
at:
http://realworldocaml.org/

Alpha 6 is the final alpha and has a completed Part III, with details on =
the runtime system, garbage collector and compiler toolchain.  It also =
contains a new Foreign Function Interface that doesn't require writing =
any C code to bind to other libraries.

Parts I and II have also seen some fairly significant revisions from the =
1250 comments we've gathered from you and our editor Andy Oram. =20

At this stage, we would particularly appreciated feedback on Part III =
chapters, as they have received less attention as they have landed later =
than the rest of the book.  This is the final alpha milestone, and a =
public beta will follow shortly.


best,

Jason, Yaron and Anil

The public beta is now out!  Further announcements will still be =

this list, as many of you are probably not the main OCaml list.

>=20
> Finally, we would especially like to thank our alpha reviewers.  Their =

portability

> * The binary serialization chapter is also incomplete, but has just =
enough
>  to teach you about the Async RPC library.
> * The installation chapter will be revised in anticipation of the =
OCaml 4.1

> * The packaging and build systems chapter hasn't been started yet.  =
We're

The second and final public beta of Real World OCaml is now available:
 <https://realworldocaml.org>

Release notes:

* Over 2,000 comments from proofreaders have been resolved.  We realize that
 reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited
 feedback!  The book is now a week away from being handed over to the
 O'Reilly production team for copyediting, so the window for changes are
 limited after that.  Comments reset between milestones and so beta2 is a
 clean slate; we're still working through some remaining older issues.

* The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects
 and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to
 Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.

* All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated.
 The source code is as close to public domain as practical, at:
     <https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples>

* The final version will have the installation chapter moved to be online
 only, and we intend to publish updates there to elaborate on installation
 and packaging mechanisms.

* Exercises will be available after we go into production, and also only be
 available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenting
 system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our readers
 on an ongoing basis.

Dear Caml-list,

After the gestation period of a respectably sized whale, we are
pleased to announce the immediate availability of Real World OCaml.
It can be freely read online under a Creative Commons license:

https://realworldocaml.org/

The book is also available from O'Reilly as a print/eBook edition:

http://oreil.ly/realworldOCaml

And also from Amazon, iBooks and the other usual book retailers.
If you enjoy it (or indeed, have criticisms), we'd welcome comments
and reviews on the various sites to help guide our efforts.
Purchasing a copy will help drive future editions and language
translations.

Real World OCaml development doesn't end here.  We've got exciting
features in the pipeline such as collaborative exercises using
js_of_ocaml to facilitate easier teaching, and various chapters
that didn't make the final book that we're planning to place online
after some editing work.

For now though, it's time to raise a glass to the fantastic community
effort that made this possible -- over 2400 (high quality) comments
in the end, and significant textual contributions from Leo White,
Jeremy Yallop, Stephen Weeks, tooling help around OPAM and UTop
from Thomas Gazagnaire, Jeremie Diminio, Louis Gesbert and his
colleagues at OCamlPro, and the constant advice from the entire
core development team led by Xavier Leroy (special thanks to Jacques
Garrigue for working hard to get the short-paths feature into OCaml
4.01).

best,
Anil, Yaron and Jason.
