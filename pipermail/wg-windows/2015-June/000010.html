<PRE>Hi all,

Setting up this list is a great initiative!


1. A few words about the use of OCaml under Windows at LexiFi

Windows is one of the most important platform we need to support, and we 
deliver GUI applications in both 32 and 64-bit, using the two MSVC 
ports.  We also ensure compatibility of our code base with the two mingw 
ports &quot;just in case&quot;  (technically, these ports allow to produce 
standalone applications that run even on a plain WinXP box, whereas the 
MSVC ports require msvcrtXX.dll, which might not be available).  We 
don't have any use for the two Cygwin ports.

We are not a &quot;Windows pure player&quot;: Linux is also an important platform 
for some of our customers and projects, and most our code base is also 
supported there.

All our code lives in a single tree whose build is managed mainly by 
omake, assuming a Cygwin environment under Windows.  Our tree also has 
code in other languages (C, Fortran, C#, etc).  We integrate a very 
small number of third-party OCaml libraries, simply by injecting their 
source code into our tree and adding tiny OMakefiles to integrate them 
in our global build system.  This is often easier than fighting with 
upstream Makefiles, etc.

For now, we don't use (nor install) ocamlfind, camlp4 or ocamlbuild. 
Our developers work typically in emacs or vim, and ocp-indent is available.

We interact with Windows and Windows libraries (in addition to what 
OCaml provides in Sys and Unix) mostly through .Net.  To this end, we 
have developped CSML, a bridge between .Net and OCaml ( 
<A HREF="https://www.lexifi.com/csml">https://www.lexifi.com/csml</A> ).  We use .Net for the UI (Windows Forms), 
for simple bindings e.g. with Oracle, Outlook, MS Excel, etc.

Our Windows application comes with a built-in small IDE that allows end 
users to edit and compile OCaml addins (which are dynlinked in the 
application upon startup).  This means that our application is shipped 
with a minimal  toolchain required to support generation of .cmxs files 
from source code: ocamlopt, flexdll and some .cmi/.cmx files.  Note that 
we don't need any external assembler or linker (our users don't need to 
install any &quot;native toolchain&quot;):

    - flexdll has a mode where it can build simple dll (cmxs) without 
relying on an external linker.  This wouldn't support linking arbitrary 
.obj files (with resources, debug information, etc), but we only need to 
support code produced by OCaml.

    - We use a modified OCaml backend that replaces emit.mlp with a 
direct x86 (32 or 64-bit) machine code emitter and a COFF object file 
output  (this was developped with the help of OCamlPro; the code is 
owned jointly by OCamlPro and LexiFi).  In OCaml's trunk, we have 
unified emit.mlp/emit_mt.mlp (for both i386 and amd64) to produce an AST 
of the generated assembly code, so our binary backend is now just an 
extra backend on this AST (in addition to the Intel and AT&amp;T textual 
emitters), which simplifies maintenance of this part quite a bit (this 
also benefits to all Windows users, since this avoids the duplication 
between emit.mlp/emit_nt.mlp, which sometimes resulted in emit_nt.mlp 
lagging behind).


Note that this couldn't be used directly to produce main programs 
without a native toolchain (with use startup objects, c lib, etc).  This 
isn't a big theoretical limitation: we could always ship an ocamlrunopt 
program that would simply dynlink a main.cmxs file appended to it -- in 
the same spirit as ocamlrun.

We also modified OCaml a little bit to make it easier to relocate the 
toolchain (which is important when you ship binary code that can be 
installed anywhere).  For instance, we changed the default path for 
looking up the standard library to make it relative to the path of the 
compiler executable (e.g. we use ../lib, starting from the directory of 
Sys.executable_name).



2. Ideas about how to improve OCaml under Windows


Globally, we find that the current state of OCaml itself is not too bad 
under Windows.  Some tiny touches would make the life easier to people 
hacking on the OCaml toolchain itself under Windows, or just building it 
from sources: for instance, adapting ./configure (or providing another 
script) instead of telling users to copy three files and edit one.  Some 
internal cleanup would also be a good idea, e.g. merging various 
Makefile and Makefile.nt, or at least sharing common parts, to avoid 
duplication and divergence, although the Continuous Integration system 
which is now in place catches many Windows build failures early, so this 
is less critical these days.  There are also deeper projects to address 
embarrassing parts, such as supporting Unicode when interacting with the 
filesystem ( <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/153">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/153</A> ); and the 
Unix.select emulation still has problems (see the &quot;OCaml windows&quot; 
category on OCaml's Mantis).

The story seems to be less nice with external tools and libraries, 
although LexiFi is not overly affected by that.  This is mostly a 
consequence of the composition of the OCaml community, which is largely 
Unix oriented.  Windows is considered as a second-class citizen by most 
OCaml core developers and package maintainers.

Excellent support of OCaml (and its ecosystem) under Windows can only be 
achieved if we manage to attract people who are primarily Windows 
developers, not Unix developers who are somehow forced to support 
Windows, or -- even worse -- who are mainly interested in porting 
existing projects from Unix to Windows.  Those people would typically be 
reluctant to use Cygwin or emacs/vim/etc.  It's not clear to me how to 
attract such people, though, since F# is a strong competitor for OCaml 
under Windows.  At least, one would need to think about how to 
articulate the benefits of OCaml, to remove technical obstacles and 
facilitate first steps with OCaml under Windows.  My intuition is that 
our goal should be to attract (enlightened) hobbyists developers under 
Windows for now (as opposed to, say, trying to make OCaml directly the 
natural choice for pure Windows companies), in order to bootstrap the 
process.

Good support for existing OCaml libraries (at least those which are 
relevant under Windows) is certainly an important goal.  Even if we 
never reach a state where OCaml is considered as a natural choice for a 
pure Windows developer or company, this will already give more 
visibility to OCaml, reinforce its already excellent cross-platform 
reputation, and help people who are forced to use Windows (or just port 
from Unix to Windows).

An important step to improve support of existing libraries under Windows
is to have good Windows support for OPAM.  This will make it easier for 
people to test libraries under Windows and so give incentive to upstream 
developers to fix them (and themselves set up a working OCaml Windows 
dev environment more easily).   Something like the OPAM Weather Service 
could be a great help here.  From what I understand, OPAM is not very 
far from supporting Windows, and I think that it's already possible to 
compile OPAM with a Cygwin port of OCaml (and have it manage native 
switches?).

I believe Cygwin will remain an important part of the story for OCaml 
under Windows for some time.  OCaml itself and many existing packages 
require a Unix-like environment in their build system, and it doesn't 
seem realistic trying to fix that soon.  Since I don't believe in binary 
distributions of OCaml packages in general (because updating a library 
forces to update all other packages that depend on it), this means that 
users would need a Cygwin environment.  Except perhaps for 
well-controlled dev environments (e.g. for LexiFi's built-in IDE, we 
don't expect users to install their own extra libraries; something 
similar could make sense for Ocsigen addins, etc).  I don't know if we 
should try to hide it as much as possible (e.g. by creating bundled 
installers) or not.  If/when OPAM supports installing native switches, 
even if itself built with Cygwin, then it could make sense to contribute 
a Cygwin package for OPAM.  At least for people using the mingw port, 
this would mean that setting up their environment could be as simple as 
installing Cygwin with a well-documented list of packages (the mingw 
compilers, flexdll, OPAM, and required extra tools such as make, etc), 
and then using OPAM to compile/install OCaml and other packages from 
sources.  (People wanting to use the MSVC ports would  need to install 
MSVC themselves.)

Making sure OPAM and existing libraries work under Windows is only the 
beginning.  Hopefully, this could be enough to attract &quot;native&quot; Windows 
developers, who could then contribute to a richer Windows experience, 
such as:

   - Binding a larger subset of the Win32 API.
   - Tools and bindings to interact with Windows applications (e.g. to 
support writing easily an OCaml addin for Excel).
   - Some GUI frontend for OPAM and a decent graphical toplevel for OCaml.
   - Better support for .Net (CSML is enough for LexiFi needs, but would 
deserve some polishing).
   - Support for popular IDEs.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Gather information from the community  about the use of the various

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Finalize OPAM support for Windows (this is listed on the OPAM 1.3
</I>&gt;<i> roadmap). When this support is in place, many OCaml packages should work
</I>&gt;<i> out of the box (with the proviso that many packages assume a unix-ish
</I>&gt;<i> environment for their build system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Discuss how to help package developers improve Windows support. One
</I>&gt;<i> way to do that could be to provide know-how about how to setup
</I>&gt;<i> continuous integration on services like Appveyor to check that packages
</I>&gt;<i> build on typical Windows setups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Find a solution for users of WODI, the GODI based OCaml distribution
</I>&gt;<i> for Windows, which has been shutdown. WODI was able to compile OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> related software (using Cygwin as an environment), but was also able to
</I>&gt;<i> install binary packages. (In some cases, some non-trivial patches  were
</I>&gt;<i> applied to make package usable on Windows.) Some of the sources needed
</I>&gt;<i> to use WODI are still available, but the system does not work out of the
</I>&gt;<i> box now that the server has gone offline. With a little work, we might
</I>&gt;<i> be able to bring it back, to smooth the transition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Discuss the state of cross compilation to Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Advertise OCamlPro's OCPWin commercial effort. (I will leave Fabrice
</I>&gt;<i> tell a bit more about that.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Discuss how to pool resources (if needed) to work toward these goals.
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks to Anil and OcamlLabs for hosting this mailing list.
