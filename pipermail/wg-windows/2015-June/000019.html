</I>&gt;<i> From Edwin T&#246;r&#246;k:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cygwin64 unreliability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if the bug is in Windows, Cygwin64 or my VM configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but the build system itself crashes a lot and randomly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (there seems to be plenty of RAM available).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even things like make.exe or rm.exe crash with: segfault, fork:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource unavailable, exit code -1073741819.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Restarting the cygwin shell helps sometimes but the errors are soon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back, even when using just make -j1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The situation was bad enough that I had to repeat the build  4-5 times
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until it finally succeeded as it kept crashing in different places.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone else tried WODI32 and didn't see such errors there, so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems like a more reliable build system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Was about to report this as a bug in Cygwin64, but next week WODI was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shutdown so that ended my Windows testing as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just opened a bug on mantis after trying to build under Cygwin64 for
</I>&gt;<i> cygwin64. I actually got two major issues.
</I>&gt;<i> First, the simple one: lots of Cygwin-specific C code doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> because it is behind #ifdef __CYGWIN32__ and that define is only for 32
</I>&gt;<i> bits.
</I>&gt;<i> The more annoying one: no flexlink binaries for Cygwin64. My
</I>&gt;<i> understanding is that there should be a flexlink_cygwin64.o file or
</I>&gt;<i> similar but currently it tries to use the 32bits .o and fails (it says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;undefined references&quot; but that's expected for such a case).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mention you used Cygwin64 quite some time ago. It is fairly young so
</I>&gt;<i> you probably tried it at a fairly early stage. With a recent
</I>&gt;<i> installation, I also got weird stuff: I couldn't pipe code to 'ocaml
</I>&gt;<i> -stdin', make wouldn't always redo .PHONY rules and not all toplevel
</I>&gt;<i> expressions in OCaml were always evaluated it /seems/ (that's something
</I>&gt;<i> I got when cross-compiling but never really understood).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall I would say the port is not in a good-enough shape to announce
</I>&gt;<i> as supported, even with limitations. That doesn't imply anything about
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows 64 port a priori.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless it is important to have cygwin ports. For a sane system, we
</I>&gt;<i> need to avoid having a cygwin shell than spawns an non-cygwin executable
</I>&gt;<i> (build tool) which then spawns a cygwin bash which spawns a non-cygwin
</I>&gt;<i> executable (ocamlopt for instance). It's better to remain in the same
</I>&gt;<i> realm (no matter which one) for as many consecutive steps as possible
</I>&gt;<i> and at least some builds will definitely continue to require a unix
</I>&gt;<i> environment.
</I>
I tried the same thing with Cygwin 32 bits on Monday and almost
everything worked at once and more importantly, there were no quantum
physics involved: thing either worked or not.
