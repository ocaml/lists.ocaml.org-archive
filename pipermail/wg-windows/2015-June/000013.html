If we are talking about building packages for native ports of OCaml 
(msvc or mingw), in which cases would one need a version of 
ocamlbuild.exe as a cygwin executable?  I'm not familiar with 
ocamlbuild, but I assume that it takes on its command-line typically 
relative paths, not absolute ones, so what would be the purpose of 
supporting POSIX-style paths (when the commands it will run expect 
Windows-style path)?

Ideally, a simple pure OCaml package should be buildable by a simple 
invocation of (native) ocamlbuild.exe without requiring a cygwin 
environment.

</I>
It's valid, but it could create problems with cmd.exe.  And OCaml 
programs tend to use cmd.exe under Windows to run external commands 
(e.g. with Sys.command).

<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10523708/why-does-the-cmd-exe-shell-on-windows-fail-with-paths-using-a-forward-slash">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10523708/why-does-the-cmd-exe-shell-on-windows-fail-with-paths-using-a-forward-slash</A>

Simply typing in cmd.exe:

   foo/bar.exe

instead of

   foo\bar.exe

fails.  One could argue that to support whitespaces in filenames, one 
should quote the program name anyway, and indeed typing

   &quot;foo/bar.exe&quot;

in cmd.exe works.
