Sorry - poor context-switching on my part! However, my comment still stands - mingw and msvc are not operating (sub-)systems &#8211; even the sub-splitting in that function still gives you operating systems. Having something akin to the comp_type seems better to me than (ab)using the notion of os.

This may play differently in an OPAM which fully supports cross-compilation, but would you expect that os variable to be the same across all switches? One thing that is certainly interesting (and which I'm doing in my Windows port of OPAM[*]) is being able to use all four native Windows ports in the same OPAM installation.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure what you're getting at here - what build system differences
</I>&gt;<i> are you referring to?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well the build system needs to adapt file extensions for one thing (which

</I>&gt;<i> distinguish the ports using the os variable in order to have a good bulk
</I>&gt;<i> variable to condition on, otherwise, if it's only the file extensions I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it's worth it.

Oh, I see - yes, the way the compilers and linkers are invoked is totally different (I for some reason thought you were meaning were different build systems themselves required). In GNU make, I use a function and $(call ...) to differentiate them - see, for example, <A HREF="https://github.com/dra27/opam/blob/0130db82f6bc49245b164d3136308531d96c786c/configure.ac#L85-L100">https://github.com/dra27/opam/blob/0130db82f6bc49245b164d3136308531d96c786c/configure.ac#L85-L100</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/dra27/opam/blob/0130db82f6bc49245b164d3136308531d96c786c/src/Makefile#L276.">https://github.com/dra27/opam/blob/0130db82f6bc49245b164d3136308531d96c786c/src/Makefile#L276.</A>

If you have comparch = cc on virtually everything (Cygwin, Mingw, most/all Unices) and comparch = msvc for the Microsoft compilers and also os being Win32, Cygwin or a variety of Unices then you have:

comparch = msvc -&gt; immediately .obj, .lib, .dll, .exe (and Microsoft invocation rules)
comparch = cc -&gt; immediately gives you .o and .a and then os &lt;&gt; Win32 gives you .so or .dll+.exe (and CC/GCC invocation rules)

Best,


D


[*] which is, of course, a) not finished and b) not necessarily going to be merged!
