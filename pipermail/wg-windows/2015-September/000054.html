It's not (necessarily) the case that the installer would want retiring (but it may well change shape, especially where installing Cygwin is concerned). OPAM expects the system already to have an OCaml compiler (usually installed by the operating system's package manager) - one of the minor changes I have yet to make is to relax this requirement for OPAM on Windows, as it is less reasonable.

However, the existence of the &quot;system&quot; switch means I was imagining that there would still want to be an installer which installs OCaml (and OPAM) &quot;for all users&quot;. Apart from anything else, it would improve the first-time OCaml user's experience as installing OPAM on a system without OCaml must necessarily add a 10 minute or so delay while OPAM builds OCaml.
