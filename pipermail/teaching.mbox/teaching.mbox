Dear Caml-list,

There have been several requests from professors who are teaching OCaml =
in schools and universities to have a forum to discuss issues relating =
to using OCaml in an educational context.

I have created the <teaching@lists.ocaml.org> mailing list for this =
purpose:

    Subscription: http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching
    Web Archives: http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/teaching/

There is an informal wiki that is gathering information for eventual =
importing to OCaml.org here:

    https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/OCAML-Teaching-Resources
   (and the associated pull request: =
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/565)

If you would like to contribute, please free to join the list by =
following the first link, or contribute pointers to useful teaching =
resources at the wiki or OCaml.org site.  In particular, if you teach a =
course and don't mind being publicly listed, adding yourself to the =
index helps other people who are considering using OCaml.

As a reminder, anyone can request a mailing list on lists.ocaml.org if =
it is relevant to the OCaml language or ecosystem.  Just drop a line to =
me or to <infrastructure@lists.ocaml.org> for more information.

best,
Anil=

Hello,

Getting a working and convenient installation of OCaml and related tools has been made easier in the past few years, but we're not quite there yet to make it a breeze to have it set up in a classroom. As the main maintainer of OPAM, and wanting to improve on this, I would be glad to know more about the actual expectations of teachers -- and the grudges they may have with the current situation.


1/ What systems does it need to work in ? Does that include Windows ? (and Cygwin ?)

Eg. what OS, and within controlled or heterogeneous installations ? We may be lacking easy way to install OCaml + tools easily on some platforms, but the issue is a bit different if we require a more strictly consistent installation across machines.

What works well currently is system packages for homebrew on OSX and various Linux distributions [1], and the all-in-one Windows packages for core OCaml [2][3]. OPAM is still lacking on Windows, and it's unlikely that we can quickly manage to have a large portion of the OPAM packages working natively soon [4]. There is always the Cygwin possibility, also.


2/ What form should the distribution be in ?

Restricting to OSX and major, not too outdated Linux distributions, getting OPAM and installing a selected set of packages on a given OCaml version should be fairly straightforward. Situation is not as bright if we want to extend on that.

We are on two parallel tracks to improve on that:
* provide better packaging (or installers) as consistently as possible on as many platforms as possible; handle external package dependencies in OPAM (non-ocaml libraries that need to be installed on the system, e.g. GTK headers for installing OPAM packages using Lablgtk)
* provide an all-in-one boxed environment containing a consistent installation of OPAM and tools in a dedicated universe

The first track is long-standing and long-term ; the second has seen two "opam-in-a-box" [5] prototypes, based resp. on Docker [6] and Vagrant [7], but they aren't yet fully satisfactory. That leaves three main options for set-up:
* system-specific packages (or bundles thereof plus some automated configuration)
* ready to use (Linux) VM images
* VM-based solution using some helper technology (Docker, Vagrant, ...)


3/ opam-in-a-box

Opam-in-a-box started as a tool to generate boxed versions of OCaml + OPAM + tools + documentation for easy deployment. I intend to improve on it but would like to make sure to do that in the right direction.

First and foremost, should it be a ready-to-use package or VM image, or rather a tool that will generate one from a set of base OPAM packages and some configuration options ? What medium should it be based on ?

Vagrant or docker make the work of bundling and configuring VMs much easier, but they'll need to be installed themselves on the host machine before we can start installing the opam-in-a-box distributed image, which seems like a major downside. Besides, Docker is Linux only, which would be a show-stopper, except that they now provide Windows and OSX installers bundled with a minimal Linux VM [8]. If their installer is customisable enough, we could imagine basing the installation on that. This starts to be many layers though, and not sure how well it can coexist with an existing Virtualbox installation.


4/ interface and documentation

Pre-configured installations of vim and emacs should be part of this. It gets more delicate to include graphical tools if we're using a VM ; but web tools (tryocaml [9], iOCamlJS [10]...) may be served from the VM.

On documentation, the new opam-doc should be ready soon ; we can let students rely on the www instance, or include a static version of documentation pages related to the included OPAM packages. Including the opam-doc tool itself seems too heavy since it relies on a patched OCaml compiler.




There doesn't seem to be an obvious ideal solution yet, so I'd be glad to know your needs more precisely to find the best compromise.

Best,
Louis Gesbert - OCamlPro

Hi Louis, hi everyone,

first, thanks for the very nice work on opam and tooling around OCaml.
Thanks also to get discussion started on this teaching mailing list :-)

a bit of context: I'm participating in several courses:
Introduction to Functional Programming, 2nd year of bachelor curriculum (L2)
Advanced Functional Programming 3rd year of bachelor curriculum (L3)
Compiler (I handle a semester-long project where student write a foo
to mips compiler,
foo being a subset of C, Java, Go, Python so far).

So I'm only answering with students following such courses in mind.
Sorry, it turned out to
be a longer answer than I expected :

Yes. A thouthand times yes. Windows, possibly without cygwin.
Especially for the L2 course, the student are still in a Math-Info
curriculum, they might need mathlab/mapple and such. Telling them to
install a dual boot or boot an usb linux thumbdrive to work with OCaml
is possible of course but still not very welcoming.
Those using OS X or linux have had no problem installing OCaml through
packages or opam, and I can easily help by spending no more than a few
minutes. Installing on windows still is problematic and, when it
fails, leaves even an advanced sysadmin dumbfounded.

There are two situations:
1) machine we provide in our labs, installed by the university sysadmin
2) students personnal machine.

For 1) we are lucky enough to have a dedicated sysadmin that install
pretty much everything we ask. The sysadmin obviously prefers using
the distro packages than opam (just because the installation is
replicated on thousands of machines and he just ticks the name of a
packages in his big list and replicate the install automatically).

For 2) as you may imagine, students have very heterogenous
hardware/distro, but most of the time its:
- a mac, with recent OS X : opam works well there (but sometimes
students don't know about it and use some package manager and it also
works well)
- a pc with linux : here no problem, they often have a recent distro
(Ubuntu or Debian most of the time)
- a pc with windows : a fairly recent version of windows: some of them
manage to download a binary version of OCaml and call it from the dos
prompt, but its not ideal.

Honestly, _for the courses I mentioned above_ (i'm stressing that, I
know that this is not what your average OCaml programmer needs), the
students don't need much:

- the ocaml compiler
- a tool to build a small project (most of the time we rely on Make
for the compilation course, and the student write ocamlc invocation by
hand in L2/L3 since they often write one-file programs. Ocamlbuild
works nicely for such courses too).
- maybe one extra package (menhir for the compilation course)

No camlp4 extension, no huge framework like core, batteries and so on.

So really, opam as it is (and if it worked on windows), would be more
than sufficient. What is need as far as teaching is concerned however
is a working graphic library (cross platform, that allows to do also a
bit of simple audio and with better support for input (mouse
buttons)). This in turn may require some system library to be
installed. I think if opam could just suggest how to install that
library for the current platform it would be enough.

A widget library would be nice, but those often come with an OO API,
which we don't want to teach for beginners course (they already have
problems with functional programming).

This is really overkill for these courses. Again starting a VM just to
program in OCaml feels a bit silly
"after all we don't need all that to program in Java, we just start
eclipse and that's it"
(I'm just playing the devil's advocate by quoting the students).

They can find the OCaml documentation online + tutorials and it works fine.
Students rarely use emacs nor vim. I tell them to do so, I install
tuareg mode for them, with easy keyboard shortcuts, but they don't
like emacs.
the concept of window vs buffer is puzzlying to them. they often open
several emacs windows (processes) each with several buffers...

To my dismay they either use gedit (on linux) or sublime text editor
(a... shareware :-( which bugs you sometimes when you try to save).
That editor just works: syntax highlighting, tabbed editor, nice
navigation features and syntactic completion (based on the symbols
that have already been typed).
So yes, the problem of having a good editor, especially for beginers
is still there.


Sorry if the answer turns out to not be around opam that much but
around the editor/libraries. After all, the students install once, at
the begining of the semester and then only program (they don't use
opam to switch compilers, install packages or what not).

Best regards,

For the functional programming course at Cornell, we dropped Windows
support in favor of a vagrant vm [1] in Fall 2013 and have since been much
happier. Students can just double-click a few things and have a working
install (complete with extra packages like pa_ounit and qcheck), and staff
no longer needs to worry about cross-platform issues (especially important
for GUIs).

My sense from having talked to a bunch of people who are teaching
these classes in the US is that Windows is probably important longer
term, but short term there are other higher value things to improve
upon.  I think having good ways of doing graphical examples is surely
one, and I tend to think that Javascript is a far better target than
X11.

I'd also love to have good default editor setups that we could
deliver, perhaps through OPAM itself.  Having a nicely set up editor
configs with things like Merlin and ocp-indent working out of the box
would be great.

I agree that having good editor set-ups would be great.  I would love one
that is compatible with Pa_ounit.

By the way, I have also found that many of my students seem to prefer using
sublime over emacs.

There appears to be Merlin support for sublime text out there:

https://github.com/Cynddl/sublime-text-merlin

I think that coming up with good default setups for Merlin and the
remaining build tools would be nice too.  For example, you want the
compiler warnings in Merlin to mesh nicely with the ones you pick in
your build.

This semester I learned that VirtualBox is not that robust. I had 150
undergrads try to use it on bad Windows machines and had quite a few
VirtualBox issues. But, Windows support can wait.

opamdoc would be the most useful thing for my classes. (E.g., something
like the documentation on Hackage.) The documentation with RWO is great.
But, I had an assignment that used Cohttp. Students had to browse .mli
files on Github, which is not that nice.

At Penn we use OCaml and OcaIDE in Eclipse, but we avoid using any fancy 
libraries -- OCaml's graphics works for us on Windows, OSX and Linux.  
We use Eclipse mainly because we also teach Java in the same class, and 
getting students to use two different editors/IDEs would be a real pain. 
We've considered using virtual machines but haven't yet gone that route, 
so Windows support is pretty important for us.

Eclipse itself is becoming more of a hassle, so we'd be willing to ditch 
it in favor of a simpler solution, but haven't yet found something we like.

Our class targets Freshman, and many non-CS students take it, so we 
can't rely on them even knowing what the terminal is.

What kind of extra windows support do you need?  Sounds like you're
sticking to fairly simple libraries, which seems like it should help a
lot.  I guess getting good Merlin support would be good.  Actually, a
high quality merlin implementation that works on Windows and
integrates with Sublime Text well could be ideal.

For what it's worth, Core_kernel is I think fully portable to Windows,
and we're thinking of having the next edition of Real World OCaml
focus more on Core_kernel than Core, which should make the text more
applicable to more cases (including the Javascript use-case.)

Apologies for replying to a digest, which I'm sure isn't the way to go. And
apologies for those of you who are already familiar with this. In any case,
I'm now teaching an intro-to-CS course at Boston College using OCaml. I'm
under the impression that most other courses using OCaml are PL courses (or
data structures or FP courses). So maybe my recent experience will fill in
a gap.

Generally speaking, my experience teaching OCaml in this pilot course has
been very good, I won't rehearse the details. But the logistics have been
fairly painful and an integrated OPAM package might reduce the pain. For
some basic information: 33 students enrolled, 22 owning macs, 11 owning
windows-based PCs. Given the choice between emacs+tuareg or eclipse+ocaide,
most of the mac owners opted for emacs. Some of our problem sets involve
graphics, some involve animation, some would use audio were it available.
The Graphics module was a problem; it uses X11, but Apple stopped bundling
X11 with OSX a few releases ago. Then, the subsequent installation of
Quartz (X11) is placed in the wrong directory so symbolic links were
required, not great for beginners. On the Windows side, it turned out that
many of the Windows-based students failed to install the Labltk module. As
I understand it, Labltk is no longer distributed with OCaml. Labltk itself
is painful (IMHO) so we spent too much time scrambling to patch things up
(and when we got it working, we had GUI code that looks like FORTRAN and
the students were wondering where all the elegant modular code went.)

So for the purposes of this particular class, I'd very much like an easy
(i.e., clickable) installation with some parts of a multimedia library (at
least graphics and simple animation but hopefully audio and UI elements
too) that is easy to use and which is consistent with OCaml's native style.
I agree with Yaron Minsky that targetting javascript would be better than
targetting X11.

My students also struggled with OCaml's error reporting, both for types and
syntax, so any package that improved error reporting would be helpful to
introductory students.

Thank you,
Bob Muller

Thanks. I forwarded this on to my students.  We'll see if some of them try
it.

Has anyone looked at using IOCaml, including for graphics? Lessons
could be distributed as notebooks and students could run the examples
and tests in-place. There's even a version that can run over a full
JavaScript kernel, which shouldn't need any installation on the part
of users. Of course, this is limited by what libraries will run when
compiled to JS (any lib that binds to C code is out of that set). I
feel that a bit more of infrastructure around IOCaml for teaching
could be immensely useful.

By the way, getting merlin to work with pa_ounit is as simple as
adding a line that says

    EXT ounit

to the .merlin file.  I'd also recommend customizing the warnings.  I
do something like this:

    FLG -w -4-33-40-41-42-43-34-44

but the choice probably depends on the approach you're taking in the
class.  Enabling type-directed constructor disambiguation is probably
not a clear win for a class, for example.

Thanks all for the extensive and fast feedback. I'll try to summarise:


# Support

There is basically no problem on Linux / OSX, but the situation is stil=
l quite bad on Windows.
Having a good installer for a working basic OPAM installation would sol=
ve the situation, but before we get there, distributing VMs is our best=
 bet. It'd be interesting to take the opportunity to point out what is =
lacking at the moment in the current distributions (besides OPAM) thoug=
h [1][2].

Web support: there are fine things going on there ; but that can't cove=
r all use-cases. Since these are by definition easily available online,=
 I think there is little point in bundling them in the box -- let's kee=
p them a different topic ; generating a web environment including a set=
 of OPAM libraries would be an interesting project, though.

So let's restart opam-in-a-box ; I'll attempt to have the editor config=
uration etc. based on OPAM rather than specific tools or shell scripts,=
 so that it's reusable.


# Libraries

Some libraries and tools like menhir, pa_ounit, qcheck that can be easi=
ly installed with OPAM or bundled are common requirements.

What's cruelly lacking, it seems, is a good, portable library for deali=
ng with graphics, and possibly sound and input. I'll try to put togethe=
r a list of candidates and discuss possibilities for improvement on a d=
ifferent thread.

We could easily choose a custom compiler as well, for example to includ=
e Arthur Chargu=E9raud's improved type errors [3]

# Documentation

This should be solved with the upcoming opam-doc release. Including pre=
-generated HTML doc of the modules included in the bundle would be a pl=
us.


# Tools

* Build system seems not to be too big of a problem for student-sized p=
rojects.

* Editors: the situation is quite fragmented with no clear winner.

    - Generic editors: emacs, vim, eclipse, gedit, sublime.
        We may include text-mode emacs and vim in the VM, but in genera=
l, that'd be too big (or even not allowed by the license for sublime). =
What we need to provide is good OCaml configuration straight out of the=
 box for all of them though.

    - Dedicated editors: there seems to be some demand for them, but no=
 satisfactory candidates. The following should work well even on Window=
s:
        (i) ocaml-top [4]: very basic GTK interface with a clean Window=
s installer, one-file editor with good OCaml support coupled with a top=
-level interface. I wrote this so I could improve on it if there is dem=
and for it (e.g. add multi-file project management).
        (ii) ocamleditor [5]: a feature-full GTK IDE. Not sure how nice=
 it is to use, but it looks a bit like Eclipse, has completion, documen=
tation, module browser... Also includes its own basic build system. Not=
 sure how it handles the toplevel.
        Has anyone tried them, or any other candidates ?

  The major work to do here is, I think, to handle a good setup for all=
 above generic editors. By which I mean ocp-indent, merlin, coloration,=
 etc. Otherwise, the issue is just deciding what editors to include.

So I'll get started on finding the best way to bundle editors setup ; a=
nd finding a good and customisable way to generate VM images.

Best,
Louis Gesbert

Indeed, we have been working for some time on improving Windows
support in the OcpWin distribution
(http://www.typerex.org/ocpwin.html), and we are interested by any
feedback on it.
Documentation is probably what is lacking behind, although the Github
pages should provide more information:
https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocpwin-distrib/blob/master/Readme.md

> Web support: there are fine things going on there ; but that can't cover =

nk there is little point in bundling them in the box -- let's keep them a d=
ifferent topic ; generating a web environment including a set of OPAM libra=
ries would be an interesting project, though.

We haven't talked about it much, but there is also the ocp-webedit project:

http://edit.ocamlpro.com/

It is an online editor, with indentation and compilation. The version
on OCamlPro's server is the old version (bytecode compilation is done
in the browser, files are stored on OCamlPro's server, and there is
only support for Str, Unix and graphics libraries, with precompiled
runtimes for Linux, Mac and Windows), while the new version that was
done this summer by an intern is supposed to be installed on a
University's server, projects are stored there, and then compiled
remotely on this server, where OPAM can be used by the teacher to
choose the libraries available to students. We haven't had time to do
a proper release, but the code is available here:

https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-webedit

Hello,
I had not enough time to reply before your summary, so I will react to =
it.

Teaching Caml at M2 level (3rd year Student of T=E9l=E9com Bretagne) in =
a language and compilation course.

My experiences:
- no real problem with using terminal for my students
- they are free to choose their editor, sublime text seems to be a =
common choice (except for the emacs / vi zealots)
- no real installation problem on their personal computer (a vast =
majority of linux and mac OS)
- installation on the school computers is more a pain because of the =
size the .opam repository, each student have a rather low disk quota =
(often they need to clean up their account before installing opam=85)
- i use utop which is much better on the field of user interaction for =
the beginning and then we switch to ocamlbuild
- given the subject, we do not need anything really fancy (UI, audio, =85)=

- we use mainly utop, menhir, merlin, ANSITerminal, ounit2, Batteries, =
...

Things, I would love:
- being able to give them a sort of meta-package requiring a set of =
libraries
- perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exists =
but I haven=92t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at the code =
of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). Why not =
also the doc?
- in utop, perhaps some integration with ocamlbuild (knowledge of =
_build, directive to relaunch ocamlbuild) and some support to read docs =
would makes it even greater
- I agree with everyone about error messages
- Student would appreciate a meta function for printing value (as the =
interpreter do) rather that writing a lot of function to do that...

I want to thanks everyone for the work done this two last because now =
the course is much more easier to teach since most of the previous =
technical difficulties have been solved. I think especially of opam, =
utop, menhir, ocaml.org <http://ocaml.org/>=85

Thanks for the feedback!

ibraries
It's possible to define one within a repository. Or, more directly, it =
should work to host an archive containing an `opam` file somewhere, and=
 then have them run `opam pin URL`.
I'll check if that works and document it somewhere (OPAM FAQ?) if that =
turns out to be useful.

> - perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exist=
s but I haven=E2=80=99t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at=
 the code of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). =
Why not also the doc?
OPAM 1.2 added the `opam source <package>` command. Damn useful :)

Hope that helps!

I think a function of type 'a -> string is not going to happen without 
horrible hacks, however, you can take the deriving route by using either 
camlp4 + sexplib/deriving or ppx_deriving (with ocaml   4.02). The 
later is a bit easier to setup, since you avoid camlp4. However, If you 
already use camlp4 for other reasons, you can't use ppx.

I often observe that when someone is trying to dig up the source of a library,
chances are that that person will also benefit from having the cmt files and the
corresponding merlin support. So these days I just recommend everyone in our
research group to set OPAMKEEPBUILDDIR to "true" in order to retain the build
directory of every package installed by opam. I believe this would be highly
applicable in a classroom setting.

I thought it might be useful to split out the discussion on specific =
technologies.  Vagrant has come up several times, and it provides a =
useful mechanism to centralise not only the compiler distribution, but =
also editor tools and support infrastructure.

We'd like to provide a Vagrant distribution for our upcoming FP course =
in Cambridge next term [1].  We already have a Vagrant VM that combines =
OCaml with the MirageOS here:=20

   https://github.com/mirage/mirage-vagrant-vms

I'm planning to split it out to make an OCaml-only base image.  If =
anyone has similar Vagrant setups that incorporate editor support and so =
on, I'd appreciate a pointer.  We're going to license our scripts under =
the CC0 public domain to make them as easily cut-and-pastable as =
possible.

There's a 'Vagrant Cloud' in beta that can host pointers to such images, =
and we're happy to host binary blobs, under a central 'ocaml' =
organisation if that's available.

+1 to Vagrant. It makes VM construction and distribution really simple. And
it makes it easy for all of us to share resources that go into VMs without
having to ship GBs of opaque images around.

Ben Greenman has already supplied a pointer to the Cornell CS 3110 Vagrant
scripts:

https://github.com/cs3110/vagrant-opam

Speaking just for myself, I'd be very happy if this stayed roughly in sync
with Anil's efforts.

On how to provide a set of libraries to install, the following is on it=
s way to the FAQ:

=C2=AB
### Easily provide a set of packages for students to install

The easiest way is to create a package with your prerequisites as `depe=
nds` and
have them pin that. A quick way to host the file is to use a
[Gist](https://gist.github.com). Create one with minimal contents and l=
isting
your packages as dependencies -- the file name **has** to be `opam`:

```
opam-version: "1.2"
name: "ocaml101"
version: "0.1"
maintainer: "Louis Gesbert <louis.gesbert@ocamlpro.com>"
depends: [ "menhir" { =3D "20140422" }
           "merlin" { >=3D "2" }
           "ocp-indent"
           "ocp-index" ]
```

Save that and get the `HTTPS clone URL`. All that is needed then is to =
run:

```shell
$ opam pin add ocaml101 <HTTPS clone URL>
```

Furthermore, `opam update` will then pick up any modification you made =
to the gist.

Cheers,
Louis

Agreed.  I think it's important not to scatter all this information too =
much as we assemble it though.

Putting all of this in the central OPAM FAQ first (perhaps with =
categories) will give us one place to point to, and we could then create =
a more domain-specific teaching page with links into to the FAQ.  I =
would, for example, also like to link into the central OPAM FAQ from the =
MirageOS site as well.

Since this is for teaching, and we already have a teaching page [1], I'd =
expect this information to be available from there.

I suggest the following:

- The general question of how you make a collection of packages =
available could go on the OPAM FAQ -- it's not just for students (so I'd =
change the title).

- Additional information, on the use-case for teaching, is added to the =
teaching page. Ideally, with a brief example/link of how a course has =
used it.

I was just chatting with Greg about this, and I wanted to broaden the
question out: how should a teacher set up a mac environment using
opam?  Ideally, it would be nice if we could give people a pretty
simple script that would get them editor configs, tools like merlin
and ocp-indent, and a set of libraries at fixed versions that won't
change for the whole semester.

Does anyone have a demo of such a thing set up?  Louis, how is your
opam-in-a-box work coming along, and is it at a point where people can
start using it?

It's not merged into OPAM yet, but see the user-setup.0.1 package that =

That seems great.  Can we get it merged in soon?  School in the US is
starting up very very soon, and I suspect a number of different
schools would find this very useful.

Now merged.  There's a failure in the OPAM 1.1 compatibility case,
and I suspect a lot of students will have the latest Ubuntu and run
into this problem (14.10 has a broken OPAM out of the box due to an=20
upstream packaging mismatch).

However, feedback from those trying it on OPAM 1.2 via:

   opam update
   opam install user-setup

would be appreciated.

user-setup seems interesting but I think for a new user it's important
to also have good guides on how to use ocp-indent and merlin. A video
would probably be even better, showing a workflow for coding OCaml
with merlin.

That sounds excellent. And if it's good by you, we can take the
results and put them on OCaml.org after the dust settles.

Thanks for the feedback. It's probably still a bit rough at the moment but the config-updating engine is there, and polishing configuration itself from there should be straight-forward (and never-ending).

The idea, with this and the "depext" package is to have a setup that can be limited to:

    PACKAGES="user-setup merlin utop cohttp js_of_ocaml oasis ocp-indent ocp-index ssl core_extended async js_of_ocaml core_bench cohttp cryptokit menhir"
    opam init -a
    opam install depext
    opam depext $PACKAGES
    opam install $PACKAGES

and results in a ready-to-go environment. This is in particular targetted at VM setup, of course.

Seems it doesn't handle the opam-installed tuareg package well at the moment, should be fixed in a moment.

Thanks. I just managed to reproduce on OPAM 1.1 and hope to fix it quickly.

Indeed.  Now I think is the time to really focus on getting it
working, because this is the beginning of the semester, and so now is
the most valuable time to have something working cleanly.

It would be good to know what we have there now.  It seems like a
minimum should be:

- tuareg
- merlin
- ocp-indent
- utop

all read to go in emacs.  Getting vim and sublime text support would
be lovely too, but I think less critical.  What does user-setup
already support?

Interesting. Concretely, what would would depext do in this context?
I did a fresh install of a number of packages on my mac, and I didn't
need much else, but I may have already had the dependencies in place
via brew.

Greg, it's also probably a good idea to encourage your students to
upgrade to the latest opam if they're on a mac.  Homebrew is pretty
lightweight, and has opam 1.2.0.

In the meantime, I've attached a dot-emacs and dot-merlin files that I
think work nicely on a mac.  The one thing you need to do is to add
this line to your .profile file:

   eval `opam config env`

The dot emacs depends on this being in place for figuring out where to
find all the executables stashed in the .opam directory.

The pre-reqs for this to work is getting tuareg downloaded and in the
proper path (right now, I assume ~/.elisp/tuareg-mode), and installing
some opam packages:

   opam install core async merlin utop ocp-indent

This should give you merlin, ocp-indent, tuareg, and utop support, all
nicely integrated.  Note that the .merlin file needs to go in the
directory where you're editing code (and really, in every directory
where you're editing code.)  And the .merlin assumes that you're using
ocamlbuild (or corebuild) and so are putting your build artifacts in
_build.

I'm hoping this is helpful.

Just released 0.2 which should fix both issues (opam tuareg mode and stalling with vim)

Needs more testing, but we do have those ; vim support also, but it's more lightly tested.
I didn't figure how to configure Sublime yet.

Not sure, but you can use `opam depext -l` to simply show the currently required external packages.

The one that bites most often on .deb distributions is the lack of m4, which is required by ocamlfind. It gets much more complicated as soon as you want to install e.g. gtk stuff, of course (ocaml-top...).

Best,
Louis

Also, I can't seem to install depext, but the reason doesn't make sense:

Kalessin:~ yminsky2$ opam install depext
[ERROR] depext is not available because your system doesn't comply
with opam-version >= "4.02".
Kalessin:~ yminsky2$ opam --version
1.2.0

I'm running the latest opam available from homebrew.

Thanks. =20

Your dot-emacs and dot-merlin work (with tuareg-2.0.8 which
is what opam installs now.)

However, font lock mode doesn=E2=80=99t automatically trigger on either
emacs or aquamacs, in spite of the fact that I added:

  (global-font-lock-mode t)

If I add a hook to try to explicitly turn on font-lock:

  (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'font-lock-fontify-buffer t)

then I get the error:

  Warning: Bug in tuareg-mode: it forgets to call `run-mode-hooks'
  File mode specification error: (void-function =
tuareg-syntax-propertize)

Hmm.  I'm still not able to get user-setup to work cleanly on my mac,
though depext does install now, and I think correctly determines that
there are no packages it needs to install.

But here are the messages I get from emacs:

Loading paren...done
Loading tuareg-site-file...done
For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a.
Making completion list...
Starting merlin instance: default (binary=ocamlmerlin).
File mode specification error: (file-error "Searching for program" "no
such file or directory" "ocamlmerlin")

So it can't seem to find merlin.

I'm also a little troubled by the hard-coding of paths in the .emacs.
Once nice thing about the dot-emacs file I shared with Greg is that it
auto-updates where it points on every opam switch, without even
needing to restart emacs, I believe.  It would be nice to have this
for merlin, though I admit perhaps not with tuareg.

I tend to think that until we get this sorted, teachers should use
manually put together dot-emacs files like the ones I emailed out.

Hmm.  Really can't replicate the problem --- font-lock works fine for
me.  Greg, can you email out your full .emacs?  And double-check the
version of emacs your running?

user-setup doesn't handle yet the Mac-specific issue of Emacs load-paths, so that's probably what is bitting you here; I'll port the related code from your .emacs; getting a means to test on these ASAP.


On hardcoding the paths, I'm still not certain it is the best option, but I had a few reasons for doing so (open for discussion, obviously, this is still a prototype):

* user-setup configures editors depending on what is installed in the current switch ; it may not make sense in other switches.

* some tools are generally useful (tuareg, ocp-indent) and installing them in one switch should be enough. There is a clear distinction though for compiler-version dependent tools (merlin, ocp-index).

* this is not focused on advanced users with multiple switches, etc. and it makes the configuration simpler to understand and edit.

* this approach is guaranteed to be available for all editors.

The alternatives would be (i) using packages supplied within the editor's ecosystems, when available (see the detailed discussion at [1]), which should clearly handle locations dynamically -- I think that best serves advanced users but has a purpose distinct enough to justify both approaches ; and (ii) dynamically generating configuration at editor run time (like ocp-edit does for emacs: it reads its own configuration and outputs elisp code that is evaluated at run time)

Note that we still hit a consistency issue with this approach if installing user-setup in multiple switches. This also raises the question of handling "global" or "multi-switch" packages in OPAM.


On the feature of dynamically adapting to the latest `opam switch` in emacs, it could be achieved by running all external commands through `opam config exec -- <command>`. It doesn't extend to running different elisp files depending on the switch though, and you'd still need to manually update PATH etc. if you're running builds within emacs, similar to `eval $(opam config env)`. I do this using:

    (defun opam-env ()
      (interactive nil)
      (dolist (var (car (read-from-string (shell-command-to-string "opam config env --sexp"))))
        (setenv (car var) (cadr var))))

opam-user-setup will set this statically, locally on caml/tuareg buffers, which may indeed not be the best idea.

Thanks for the feedback, it'll help make this usable quick

My apologies.  I just put up a post about all this on the platform
list, so I've now split the discussion.  How about we move the
conversation over there.  I think we probably shouldn't come back to
the teaching list until we've resolved some more of these questions
anyway.

The emacs version is 24.4.1.  The .emacs file is the one you sent
me.  When I fire this up, font-lock-mode is enabled, but nothing
is colorized when I load a .ml file.  If I explicitly font-lock-
fontify-buffer, and then type anything, I get the error message:

  Symbol=E2=80=99s function definition is void:  =
tuareg-syntax-propertize

I=E2=80=99m going to try the most recent head of tuareg to see if this
fixes the problem.

(NB:  same behavior under latest Aquamacs.) =20

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The dot emacs depends on this being in place f=
or figuring out where to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find all the executables stashed in the .opam =
directory.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The pre-reqs for this to work is getting tuare=
g downloaded and in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proper path (right now, I assume ~/.elisp/tuar=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some opam packages:<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opam install core async merlin utop ocp-indent=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This should give you merlin, ocp-indent, tuare=
g, and utop support, all<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nicely integrated.=C2=A0 Note that the .merlin=
 file needs to go in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; directory where you&#39;re editing code (and r=
eally, in every directory<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where you&#39;re editing code.)=C2=A0 And the =
.merlin assumes that you&#39;re using<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ocamlbuild (or corebuild) and so are putting y=
our build artifacts in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _build.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m hoping this is helpful.<br>

Greetings, things have gone sideways for me with opam since upgrading my
OSX to 10.10.  In particular, my attempt to reinstall Kenichi Asai's
Universe library is failing because opam is failing in its attempt to
install lablgtk. I'm pretty sure this problem is solved somewhere but I'm
not finding a solution or workaround.

I'm pretty sure this isn't the right forum for posting this sort of
problem, but I checked the opam FAQ and couldn't find any other obvious
spot, and I've been seeing traffic relating to problems with opam. Hints as
to where to post this kind of thing would be appreciated.

Anyway, as far as I can tell, the gcc compiler seems to fail because it's
invoked with a switch:

-fno-defer-pop

that it doesn't recognize. I'm under the impression that earlier versions
of Xcode treated this as a warning rather than an error, but I'm getting:

# clang: error: unknown argument: '-fno-defer-pop'
I'm running OSX 10.10.1 and Xcode 6.1.1. Any hints appreciated.

Thanks,
Bob Muller

Hi Robert,

What version of ocaml are you using?  This was fixed shortly after 10.10
was released.  See <http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6346> for
details.

Cheers,
Nicolas

This is the key error, as the base C compiler changed in MacOS X 10.10, =
but you haven't reinstalled OCaml (which thinks you still have the old =
compiler). Do "brew reinstall ocaml" (or upgrade, or whatever it is) to =
get a new installation, and you should be set.  You should generally do =
this when you upgrade your OSX or you'll have problems with other =
Homebrew packages too.

It looks like these are all heading in roughly the same direction.  =
Richard Mortier has been cleaning up the Mirage Vagrant image (which in =
turn uses OCaml and OPAM), and it has a slightly more sophisticated =
networking setup.

I'll look into the Vagrant registry once the Mirage one settles down a =
bit.

Hello,

I have recently started using Arthur Charguraud's experimental OCaml
compiler and top-level with improved type error messages. This is great
and the students are now able to gain better autonomy in programming. I
modified the OCaml source code to enable easy-type-errors by default.

However, Arthur's patch cannot improve runtime error messages, like the
frequent Out-of-bound access exception. For this, I would like the OCaml
toplevel to automatically print a backtrace.

I understand that I should do two things :
 1. compile the toplevel with -g
 2. run the toplevel with OCAMLRUNPARAM set to B.

I do not understand however what I should change in the makefiles to
pass the -g option correctly (my attempts were not successful), and I am
not sure what parts of the OCaml source code I should change to get de
backtrace printing behaviour enabled by default.

Can somebody help ?

I don't think you need the toplevel itself to be compiled with -g to get
stack traces (that would be true of stack traces raised by exception inside
the toplevel implementation, but those correspond to OCaml implementation
bugs, not to bugs in your student's programs). However, in existing
released versions of OCaml I suspect that stack traces are not available
for code defined from the toplevel (I think it works for libraries compiled
outside the toplevel and linked/loaded from the toplevel, but not for
functions defined directly by sending phrases to the toplevel). This was
the topic of the issue report PR#6468 (
http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=3D6468 ), and Peter Zotov developed=
 a
patch to implement that feature. It will be available in the next *major*
release of the OCaml distribution (around autumn/winter), but if you
already maintain a fork you could try to backport it.

Thanks for this information.

Alas, the most recent common ancestor between Arthur Charguraud's
changes and the integration of PR#6468 into master seems to be commit
c82c004286dae541583a45cff042624b3770b7a0 in the git repo, which dates
back to 2014-05-12 (exactly 1 year ago).

My near-zero understanding of the internals of the OCaml implementation
does not enable me to merge.

[ Cross posting from the Caml-list, following several suggestions to do so :-) ]

We are very pleased to announce the massive, open, online course

  Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml

the first MOOC entirely devoted to our beloved OCaml programming language.

All the information on the course, including a teaser video, is available at 
 
   https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/parisdiderot/56002/session01/about

The course is in english, starts from the basics, and goes on for seven weeks up
to the module system. 

An interactive exercise environment will allow to do the exercises in the
browser, with an online evaluation integrated in the learning system; as you
expect, this is based on tryocaml and js_of_ocaml, and is a unique
distinguishing feature of this MOOC.

The learning platform happens to be called FUN (yes, great to have fun with
functional programming :-)), that is a variant of Open EdX run by the french
ministry of education.

The registration is open, and the course will start on October 19th.

We finally have a MOOC on OCaml, a great tool to bring functional
programming and our preferred programming language to a wide audience:
now, let's tell the world! Use your social networks, mailing lists,
professional and non professional conferences to spread the word.

And see you soon for our first course :-)

Caveat: this is a general answer, my point of view, and not done with OCa=
ml

It certainly is technically feasible, depending on your desktop hardware =
even easy to do.

You need a VM software. I had good experiences with Virtualbox. With MS s=
olutions you=20
must find the right product for your Win version
(Virtual PC or Hyperv ) - I don't think it will beat Virtualbox in your s=
cenario.

Disk space: starting from 3G for the OS and ~4G for the opam directory, t=
his all=20
depends directly on what you install.
You need quite some compilers, make and tools, and devel packages. Do a p=
ilot=20
install, of course.

Linux distro: any current distribution will do. Performance will not be m=
uch of an=20
issue unless you have very weak desktops. I am using virtualbox on my old=
 notebook.=20
But some ocaml package compile times are quite long even on beefy machine=
s (coq comes=20
to mind).

As for the desktop environment: lighter is better, but not an issue eithe=
r, even on=20
KDE you can turn off effects and background tasks to speed it up.
Take what you and your students know.

skipping "... usual software ... coq ..." - is it an ocaml introduction ?=
 :-)

But:

There is a big risk of wasting time with subjects not in the centre of yo=
ur course,=20
especially Linux setup and use.

This depends directly on the "unix/linux literacy" of your students.

I highly recommend that you look into vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/
Last time I helped run a class that needed standardized components, vagrant
was the easiest choice. It's very uniform (everyone has the 'vagrant' user
by default), automatically sets up sharing of directories, and allows for
bring-up/tear-down/sshing in using very simple commands. You'll be able to
post simple instructions that everyone will be able to follow.

I recommend sticking with an Ubuntu distribution. Anything else will be
much harder to support.

Of course, a more ideal setting is to have everyone use the University's
standard unix accounts, as those will be even more standardized. But this
is a close second.

One fairly easy way to get the VM images that is portable across =

--f46d04426e208af113051eb03a4d
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Thank you for the advice.

To clarify what I'm looking for: I'm trying to make Linux usage as
transparent as possible, exactly to avoid requiring much unix literacy,
hence why I mentioned disk space usage. It's not so much an issue in
itself, but if I wanted to distribute a static VM image with everything
already installed, its size might become an issue.

For instance, Eclipse, which used to be a quite large application, has a
download size of 270 MB. It does not include the JVM, but after
decompressing I'd estimate it (Eclipse + JVM) at about 1 GB.

I don't know the exact size of Xcode, but some websites estimate it at 2-4
GB.

Visual Studio is probably the largest one, at about 6 GB.

Certainly, installing a Linux via a VM includes much more than an IDE +
compiler + runtime, but if it requires 7GB, it's still a hard pill to
swallow.

This brings me to another point: disk usage anxiety. Even with dynamic disk
images, I'm afraid to give them a large size, so I end up worrying that it
will run out of space. And the kinds of errors that happen in such
situations are much less obvious to understand, especially for linux
newbies. Should I just lose my fear and allow my disk images to dynamically
grow to be as large as they want to be?

For those reasons, I asked about a minimalistic Linux with the lightest
possible UI, to save on disk space as much as possible. It's not so much
about CPU, which for the intended purposes should be mostly fine.

Finally, on the issue of transparency, another major difficulty I have when
using a Linux VM is that the file systems are separate, so even if I tell
the students to "just download that file and open it on your
<Linux/OCaml-based application>", they'll either:

a) Download it using Windows, then not be able to find the file using the
Linux application (or have to move it to a shared folder, which they often
forget);
b) Be forced to use a browser inside Linux, which requires more disk space,
setting up the browser, etc.

I never found it very easy to configure Samba shares on Linux or to set up
the filesystem in a way that maximum sharing could be achieved with minimal
user intervention, especially without knowing in advance some parameters
such as host/username, etc. Which would make it even more complicated to
set up in advance in a static VM image for that purpose.

Is there a better solution concerning transparency between Windows and
Linux for OCaml usage purposes? E.g. using a Merlin-configured Emacs from
Linux that could open a file downloaded via Windows and then compile an
OCaml application that could easily read the files in a Windows directory
to perform some action on them? It sounds almost like Cygwin, but that's
another can of worms...

Any partial solutions or tips you can give me about each of these issues is
already greatly useful to me. I usually end up finding some solutions
myself, but it takes a lot of time searching and trying, and if someone had
already done exactly the same thing before, well, I'd be glad to learn from
them!

Best regards,

The cs3110 vagrant script <https://github.com/cs3110/vagrant-opam> unpacks
to a 4.5GB machine after a small initial download from github. This
includes the chromium browser (much easier than setting up shared folders),
but not eclipse, xcode, or visual studio. Instead, we include basic emacs,
vim, and sublime configurations.

We used the lubuntu <http://lubuntu.net/> distribution to help keep things
small.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Greetings. As I understand it, an upcoming release of OCaml is going to
support anonymous (or were they called "inlined"??) records. This is going
to be very helpful in an intro classroom where students will be able to
work with more intuitive definitions of trees. I assume that we'll be able
to write something like:

type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of {info: 'a; left : 'a tree; right : 'a
tree}

and we won't have to fiddle around with mutually recursive type
definitions. We will be distributing a VM to students at the start of class
(January 19). I would prefer to distribute only one VM during the semester
and I would prefer that the VM was configured with the compiler supporting
anonymous records.

Can someone let me know how these chips are going to fall?

Thanks!
Bob Muller

Not an answer to your question, but some students find intuition in 
simply reordering to put 'left' on the left and 'right' on the right, 
with the data in the middle:

type 'a tree = Leaf | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree

Also a question: your type has data at the leaf as well as at nodes. 
Most people don't do that for a standard tree type, seeing the form I 
give above as more "natural" -- do you find your way has a teaching (or 
other) advantage?

John

Greetings John. Fair enough. What I usually use is something along the
lines of:

type 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree

I would prefer to use a record for the Node case but in my experience
having to cobble together mutually recursive types as in:

*type* 'a node = {info: 'a; left: 'a tree; right: 'a tree}
>
> *and* 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a node

is basically a show stopper for many --- it needlessly obscures the natural
recursive structure of the tree.
