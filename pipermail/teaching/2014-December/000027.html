<PRE>On how to provide a set of libraries to install, the following is on its way to the FAQ:

&#171;
### Easily provide a set of packages for students to install

The easiest way is to create a package with your prerequisites as `depends` and
have them pin that. A quick way to host the file is to use a
[Gist](<A HREF="https://gist.github.com">https://gist.github.com</A>). Create one with minimal contents and listing
your packages as dependencies -- the file name **has** to be `opam`:

```
opam-version: &quot;1.2&quot;
name: &quot;ocaml101&quot;
version: &quot;0.1&quot;
maintainer: &quot;Louis Gesbert &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching">louis.gesbert at ocamlpro.com</A>&gt;&quot;
depends: [ &quot;menhir&quot; { = &quot;20140422&quot; }
           &quot;merlin&quot; { &gt;= &quot;2&quot; }
           &quot;ocp-indent&quot;
           &quot;ocp-index&quot; ]
```

Save that and get the `HTTPS clone URL`. All that is needed then is to run:

```shell
$ opam pin add ocaml101 &lt;HTTPS clone URL&gt;
```

Furthermore, `opam update` will then pick up any modification you made to the gist.
&#187;

Cheers,
Louis

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Things, I would love:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - being able to give them a sort of meta-package requiring a set of libraries
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible to define one within a repository. Or, more directly, it should work to host an archive containing an `opam` file somewhere, and then have them run `opam pin URL`.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll check if that works and document it somewhere (OPAM FAQ?) if that turns out to be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exists but I haven&#8217;t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at the code of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). Why not also the doc?
</I>&gt;<i> OPAM 1.2 added the `opam source &lt;package&gt;` command. Damn useful :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that helps!
