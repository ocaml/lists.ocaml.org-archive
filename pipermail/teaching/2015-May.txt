Subject: [Teaching] Backtraces in toplevel
Message-ID: <5551BE57.9050508@prepas.org>

Hello,

I have recently started using Arthur Chargu?raud's experimental OCaml
compiler and top-level with improved type error messages. This is great
and the students are now able to gain better autonomy in programming. I
modified the OCaml source code to enable easy-type-errors by default.

However, Arthur's patch cannot improve runtime error messages, like the
frequent Out-of-bound access exception. For this, I would like the OCaml
toplevel to automatically print a backtrace.

I understand that I should do two things :
 1. compile the toplevel with -g
 2. run the toplevel with OCAMLRUNPARAM set to B.

I do not understand however what I should change in the makefiles to
pass the -g option correctly (my attempts were not successful), and I am
not sure what parts of the OCaml source code I should change to get de
backtrace printing behaviour enabled by default.

Can somebody help ?

I don't think you need the toplevel itself to be compiled with -g to get
stack traces (that would be true of stack traces raised by exception inside
the toplevel implementation, but those correspond to OCaml implementation
bugs, not to bugs in your student's programs). However, in existing
released versions of OCaml I suspect that stack traces are not available
for code defined from the toplevel (I think it works for libraries compiled
outside the toplevel and linked/loaded from the toplevel, but not for
functions defined directly by sending phrases to the toplevel). This was
the topic of the issue report PR#6468 (
http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6468 ), and Peter Zotov developed a
patch to implement that feature. It will be available in the next *major*
release of the OCaml distribution (around autumn/winter), but if you
already maintain a fork you could try to backport it.

Thanks for this information.

Alas, the most recent common ancestor between Arthur Chargu?raud's
changes and the integration of PR#6468 into master seems to be commit
c82c004286dae541583a45cff042624b3770b7a0 in the git repo, which dates
back to 2014-05-12 (exactly 1 year ago).

My near-zero understanding of the internals of the OCaml implementation
does not enable me to merge.
