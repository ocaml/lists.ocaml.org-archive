It looks like these are all heading in roughly the same direction.  Richard Mortier has been cleaning up the Mirage Vagrant image (which in turn uses OCaml and OPAM), and it has a slightly more sophisticated networking setup.

I'll look into the Vagrant registry once the Mirage one settles down a bit.
