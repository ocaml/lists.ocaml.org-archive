Subject: [Teaching] opam installation problem
Message-ID: <CAKmYinn0i6Hp1BhiU0zQ644q25tcE7r9Bhm+u=-00KM1uV8S=w@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings, things have gone sideways for me with opam since upgrading my
OSX to 10.10.  In particular, my attempt to reinstall Kenichi Asai's
Universe library is failing because opam is failing in its attempt to
install lablgtk. I'm pretty sure this problem is solved somewhere but I'm
not finding a solution or workaround.

I'm pretty sure this isn't the right forum for posting this sort of
problem, but I checked the opam FAQ and couldn't find any other obvious
spot, and I've been seeing traffic relating to problems with opam. Hints as
to where to post this kind of thing would be appreciated.

Anyway, as far as I can tell, the gcc compiler seems to fail because it's
invoked with a switch:

-fno-defer-pop

that it doesn't recognize. I'm under the impression that earlier versions
of Xcode treated this as a warning rather than an error, but I'm getting:

# clang: error: unknown argument: '-fno-defer-pop'
I'm running OSX 10.10.1 and Xcode 6.1.1. Any hints appreciated.

Thanks,
Bob Muller

Hi Robert,

What version of ocaml are you using?  This was fixed shortly after 10.10
was released.  See <http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6346> for
details.

Cheers,
Nicolas

This is the key error, as the base C compiler changed in MacOS X 10.10, but you haven't reinstalled OCaml (which thinks you still have the old compiler). Do "brew reinstall ocaml" (or upgrade, or whatever it is) to get a new installation, and you should be set.  You should generally do this when you upgrade your OSX or you'll have problems with other Homebrew packages too.
