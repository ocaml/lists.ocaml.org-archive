<PRE>Greetings. As I understand it, an upcoming release of OCaml is going to
support anonymous (or were they called &quot;inlined&quot;??) records. This is going
to be very helpful in an intro classroom where students will be able to
work with more intuitive definitions of trees. I assume that we'll be able
to write something like:

type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of {info: 'a; left : 'a tree; right : 'a
tree}

and we won't have to fiddle around with mutually recursive type
definitions. We will be distributing a VM to students at the start of class
(January 19). I would prefer to distribute only one VM during the semester
and I would prefer that the VM was configured with the compiler supporting
anonymous records.

Can someone let me know how these chips are going to fall?

Thanks!
Bob Muller
