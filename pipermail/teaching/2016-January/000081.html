Not an answer to your question, but some students find intuition in 
simply reordering to put 'left' on the left and 'right' on the right, 
with the data in the middle:

type 'a tree = Leaf | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree

Also a question: your type has data at the leaf as well as at nodes. 
Most people don't do that for a standard tree type, seeing the form I 
give above as more &quot;natural&quot; -- do you find your way has a teaching (or 
other) advantage?

John
