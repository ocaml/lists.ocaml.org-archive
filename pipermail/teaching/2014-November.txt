Dear Caml-list,

There have been several requests from professors who are teaching OCaml in schools and universities to have a forum to discuss issues relating to using OCaml in an educational context.

I have created the <teaching at lists.ocaml.org> mailing list for this purpose:

    Subscription: http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching
    Web Archives: http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/teaching/

There is an informal wiki that is gathering information for eventual importing to OCaml.org here:

    https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/OCAML-Teaching-Resources
   (and the associated pull request: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/565)

If you would like to contribute, please free to join the list by following the first link, or contribute pointers to useful teaching resources at the wiki or OCaml.org site.  In particular, if you teach a course and don't mind being publicly listed, adding yourself to the index helps other people who are considering using OCaml.

As a reminder, anyone can request a mailing list on lists.ocaml.org if it is relevant to the OCaml language or ecosystem.  Just drop a line to me or to <infrastructure at lists.ocaml.org> for more information.

best,
Anil

Subject: [Teaching] Asking teachers: what support would you want to
	distribute OCaml to students ?
Message-ID: <2760196.8fJfC8MCyl@agaric>

Hello,

Getting a working and convenient installation of OCaml and related tools has been made easier in the past few years, but we're not quite there yet to make it a breeze to have it set up in a classroom. As the main maintainer of OPAM, and wanting to improve on this, I would be glad to know more about the actual expectations of teachers -- and the grudges they may have with the current situation.


1/ What systems does it need to work in ? Does that include Windows ? (and Cygwin ?)

Eg. what OS, and within controlled or heterogeneous installations ? We may be lacking easy way to install OCaml + tools easily on some platforms, but the issue is a bit different if we require a more strictly consistent installation across machines.

What works well currently is system packages for homebrew on OSX and various Linux distributions [1], and the all-in-one Windows packages for core OCaml [2][3]. OPAM is still lacking on Windows, and it's unlikely that we can quickly manage to have a large portion of the OPAM packages working natively soon [4]. There is always the Cygwin possibility, also.


2/ What form should the distribution be in ?

Restricting to OSX and major, not too outdated Linux distributions, getting OPAM and installing a selected set of packages on a given OCaml version should be fairly straightforward. Situation is not as bright if we want to extend on that.

We are on two parallel tracks to improve on that:
* provide better packaging (or installers) as consistently as possible on as many platforms as possible; handle external package dependencies in OPAM (non-ocaml libraries that need to be installed on the system, e.g. GTK headers for installing OPAM packages using Lablgtk)
* provide an all-in-one boxed environment containing a consistent installation of OPAM and tools in a dedicated universe

The first track is long-standing and long-term ; the second has seen two "opam-in-a-box" [5] prototypes, based resp. on Docker [6] and Vagrant [7], but they aren't yet fully satisfactory. That leaves three main options for set-up:
* system-specific packages (or bundles thereof plus some automated configuration)
* ready to use (Linux) VM images
* VM-based solution using some helper technology (Docker, Vagrant, ...)


3/ opam-in-a-box

Opam-in-a-box started as a tool to generate boxed versions of OCaml + OPAM + tools + documentation for easy deployment. I intend to improve on it but would like to make sure to do that in the right direction.

First and foremost, should it be a ready-to-use package or VM image, or rather a tool that will generate one from a set of base OPAM packages and some configuration options ? What medium should it be based on ?

Vagrant or docker make the work of bundling and configuring VMs much easier, but they'll need to be installed themselves on the host machine before we can start installing the opam-in-a-box distributed image, which seems like a major downside. Besides, Docker is Linux only, which would be a show-stopper, except that they now provide Windows and OSX installers bundled with a minimal Linux VM [8]. If their installer is customisable enough, we could imagine basing the installation on that. This starts to be many layers though, and not sure how well it can coexist with an existing Virtualbox installation.


4/ interface and documentation

Pre-configured installations of vim and emacs should be part of this. It gets more delicate to include graphical tools if we're using a VM ; but web tools (tryocaml [9], iOCamlJS [10]...) may be served from the VM.

On documentation, the new opam-doc should be ready soon ; we can let students rely on the www instance, or include a static version of documentation pages related to the included OPAM packages. Including the opam-doc tool itself seems too heavy since it relies on a patched OCaml compiler.




There doesn't seem to be an obvious ideal solution yet, so I'd be glad to know your needs more precisely to find the best compromise.

Best,
Louis Gesbert - OCamlPro

Hi Louis, hi everyone,

first, thanks for the very nice work on opam and tooling around OCaml.
Thanks also to get discussion started on this teaching mailing list :-)

a bit of context: I'm participating in several courses:
Introduction to Functional Programming, 2nd year of bachelor curriculum (L2)
Advanced Functional Programming 3rd year of bachelor curriculum (L3)
Compiler (I handle a semester-long project where student write a foo
to mips compiler,
foo being a subset of C, Java, Go, Python so far).

So I'm only answering with students following such courses in mind.
Sorry, it turned out to
be a longer answer than I expected :

Yes. A thouthand times yes. Windows, possibly without cygwin.
Especially for the L2 course, the student are still in a Math-Info
curriculum, they might need mathlab/mapple and such. Telling them to
install a dual boot or boot an usb linux thumbdrive to work with OCaml
is possible of course but still not very welcoming.
Those using OS X or linux have had no problem installing OCaml through
packages or opam, and I can easily help by spending no more than a few
minutes. Installing on windows still is problematic and, when it
fails, leaves even an advanced sysadmin dumbfounded.

There are two situations:
1) machine we provide in our labs, installed by the university sysadmin
2) students personnal machine.

For 1) we are lucky enough to have a dedicated sysadmin that install
pretty much everything we ask. The sysadmin obviously prefers using
the distro packages than opam (just because the installation is
replicated on thousands of machines and he just ticks the name of a
packages in his big list and replicate the install automatically).

For 2) as you may imagine, students have very heterogenous
hardware/distro, but most of the time its:
- a mac, with recent OS X : opam works well there (but sometimes
students don't know about it and use some package manager and it also
works well)
- a pc with linux : here no problem, they often have a recent distro
(Ubuntu or Debian most of the time)
- a pc with windows : a fairly recent version of windows: some of them
manage to download a binary version of OCaml and call it from the dos
prompt, but its not ideal.

Honestly, _for the courses I mentioned above_ (i'm stressing that, I
know that this is not what your average OCaml programmer needs), the
students don't need much:

- the ocaml compiler
- a tool to build a small project (most of the time we rely on Make
for the compilation course, and the student write ocamlc invocation by
hand in L2/L3 since they often write one-file programs. Ocamlbuild
works nicely for such courses too).
- maybe one extra package (menhir for the compilation course)

No camlp4 extension, no huge framework like core, batteries and so on.

So really, opam as it is (and if it worked on windows), would be more
than sufficient. What is need as far as teaching is concerned however
is a working graphic library (cross platform, that allows to do also a
bit of simple audio and with better support for input (mouse
buttons)). This in turn may require some system library to be
installed. I think if opam could just suggest how to install that
library for the current platform it would be enough.

A widget library would be nice, but those often come with an OO API,
which we don't want to teach for beginners course (they already have
problems with functional programming).

This is really overkill for these courses. Again starting a VM just to
program in OCaml feels a bit silly
"after all we don't need all that to program in Java, we just start
eclipse and that's it"
(I'm just playing the devil's advocate by quoting the students).

They can find the OCaml documentation online + tutorials and it works fine.
Students rarely use emacs nor vim. I tell them to do so, I install
tuareg mode for them, with easy keyboard shortcuts, but they don't
like emacs.
the concept of window vs buffer is puzzlying to them. they often open
several emacs windows (processes) each with several buffers...

To my dismay they either use gedit (on linux) or sublime text editor
(a... shareware :-( which bugs you sometimes when you try to save).
That editor just works: syntax highlighting, tabbed editor, nice
navigation features and syntactic completion (based on the symbols
that have already been typed).
So yes, the problem of having a good editor, especially for beginers
is still there.


Sorry if the answer turns out to not be around opam that much but
around the editor/libraries. After all, the students install once, at
the begining of the semester and then only program (they don't use
opam to switch compilers, install packages or what not).

Best regards,

For the functional programming course at Cornell, we dropped Windows
support in favor of a vagrant vm [1] in Fall 2013 and have since been much
happier. Students can just double-click a few things and have a working
install (complete with extra packages like pa_ounit and qcheck), and staff
no longer needs to worry about cross-platform issues (especially important
for GUIs).

My sense from having talked to a bunch of people who are teaching
these classes in the US is that Windows is probably important longer
term, but short term there are other higher value things to improve
upon.  I think having good ways of doing graphical examples is surely
one, and I tend to think that Javascript is a far better target than
X11.

I'd also love to have good default editor setups that we could
deliver, perhaps through OPAM itself.  Having a nicely set up editor
configs with things like Merlin and ocp-indent working out of the box
would be great.

I agree that having good editor set-ups would be great.  I would love one
that is compatible with Pa_ounit.

By the way, I have also found that many of my students seem to prefer using
sublime over emacs.

There appears to be Merlin support for sublime text out there:

https://github.com/Cynddl/sublime-text-merlin

I think that coming up with good default setups for Merlin and the
remaining build tools would be nice too.  For example, you want the
compiler warnings in Merlin to mesh nicely with the ones you pick in
your build.

This semester I learned that VirtualBox is not that robust. I had 150
undergrads try to use it on bad Windows machines and had quite a few
VirtualBox issues. But, Windows support can wait.

opamdoc would be the most useful thing for my classes. (E.g., something
like the documentation on Hackage.) The documentation with RWO is great.
But, I had an assignment that used Cohttp. Students had to browse .mli
files on Github, which is not that nice.

At Penn we use OCaml and OcaIDE in Eclipse, but we avoid using any fancy 
libraries -- OCaml's graphics works for us on Windows, OSX and Linux.  
We use Eclipse mainly because we also teach Java in the same class, and 
getting students to use two different editors/IDEs would be a real pain. 
We've considered using virtual machines but haven't yet gone that route, 
so Windows support is pretty important for us.

Eclipse itself is becoming more of a hassle, so we'd be willing to ditch 
it in favor of a simpler solution, but haven't yet found something we like.

Our class targets Freshman, and many non-CS students take it, so we 
can't rely on them even knowing what the terminal is.

What kind of extra windows support do you need?  Sounds like you're
sticking to fairly simple libraries, which seems like it should help a
lot.  I guess getting good Merlin support would be good.  Actually, a
high quality merlin implementation that works on Windows and
integrates with Sublime Text well could be ideal.

For what it's worth, Core_kernel is I think fully portable to Windows,
and we're thinking of having the next edition of Real World OCaml
focus more on Core_kernel than Core, which should make the text more
applicable to more cases (including the Javascript use-case.)

Subject: [Teaching] Asking teachers: what support would you want to
 distribute OCaml to students ? (Yaron Minsky)
Message-ID: <CAKmYin=ZKB_zY22-OCHFWegb3BwP=jFYsQJsbRWhm0TDZZ6SwA@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for replying to a digest, which I'm sure isn't the way to go. And
apologies for those of you who are already familiar with this. In any case,
I'm now teaching an intro-to-CS course at Boston College using OCaml. I'm
under the impression that most other courses using OCaml are PL courses (or
data structures or FP courses). So maybe my recent experience will fill in
a gap.

Generally speaking, my experience teaching OCaml in this pilot course has
been very good, I won't rehearse the details. But the logistics have been
fairly painful and an integrated OPAM package might reduce the pain. For
some basic information: 33 students enrolled, 22 owning macs, 11 owning
windows-based PCs. Given the choice between emacs+tuareg or eclipse+ocaide,
most of the mac owners opted for emacs. Some of our problem sets involve
graphics, some involve animation, some would use audio were it available.
The Graphics module was a problem; it uses X11, but Apple stopped bundling
X11 with OSX a few releases ago. Then, the subsequent installation of
Quartz (X11) is placed in the wrong directory so symbolic links were
required, not great for beginners. On the Windows side, it turned out that
many of the Windows-based students failed to install the Labltk module. As
I understand it, Labltk is no longer distributed with OCaml. Labltk itself
is painful (IMHO) so we spent too much time scrambling to patch things up
(and when we got it working, we had GUI code that looks like FORTRAN and
the students were wondering where all the elegant modular code went.)

So for the purposes of this particular class, I'd very much like an easy
(i.e., clickable) installation with some parts of a multimedia library (at
least graphics and simple animation but hopefully audio and UI elements
too) that is easy to use and which is consistent with OCaml's native style.
I agree with Yaron Minsky that targetting javascript would be better than
targetting X11.

My students also struggled with OCaml's error reporting, both for types and
syntax, so any package that improved error reporting would be helpful to
introductory students.

Thank you,
Bob Muller

Has anyone looked at using IOCaml, including for graphics? Lessons
could be distributed as notebooks and students could run the examples
and tests in-place. There's even a version that can run over a full
JavaScript kernel, which shouldn't need any installation on the part
of users. Of course, this is limited by what libraries will run when
compiled to JS (any lib that binds to C code is out of that set). I
feel that a bit more of infrastructure around IOCaml for teaching
could be immensely useful.

By the way, getting merlin to work with pa_ounit is as simple as
adding a line that says

    EXT ounit

to the .merlin file.  I'd also recommend customizing the warnings.  I
do something like this:

    FLG -w -4-33-40-41-42-43-34-44

but the choice probably depends on the approach you're taking in the
class.  Enabling type-directed constructor disambiguation is probably
not a clear win for a class, for example.

Also, if you're working with Core, I highly suggest to add this line to
.merlin:

FLG -short-paths

Thanks all for the extensive and fast feedback. I'll try to summarise:


# Support

There is basically no problem on Linux / OSX, but the situation is still quite bad on Windows.
Having a good installer for a working basic OPAM installation would solve the situation, but before we get there, distributing VMs is our best bet. It'd be interesting to take the opportunity to point out what is lacking at the moment in the current distributions (besides OPAM) though [1][2].

Web support: there are fine things going on there ; but that can't cover all use-cases. Since these are by definition easily available online, I think there is little point in bundling them in the box -- let's keep them a different topic ; generating a web environment including a set of OPAM libraries would be an interesting project, though.

So let's restart opam-in-a-box ; I'll attempt to have the editor configuration etc. based on OPAM rather than specific tools or shell scripts, so that it's reusable.


# Libraries

Some libraries and tools like menhir, pa_ounit, qcheck that can be easily installed with OPAM or bundled are common requirements.

What's cruelly lacking, it seems, is a good, portable library for dealing with graphics, and possibly sound and input. I'll try to put together a list of candidates and discuss possibilities for improvement on a different thread.

We could easily choose a custom compiler as well, for example to include Arthur Chargu?raud's improved type errors [3]

# Documentation

This should be solved with the upcoming opam-doc release. Including pre-generated HTML doc of the modules included in the bundle would be a plus.


# Tools

* Build system seems not to be too big of a problem for student-sized projects.

* Editors: the situation is quite fragmented with no clear winner.

    - Generic editors: emacs, vim, eclipse, gedit, sublime.
        We may include text-mode emacs and vim in the VM, but in general, that'd be too big (or even not allowed by the license for sublime). What we need to provide is good OCaml configuration straight out of the box for all of them though.

    - Dedicated editors: there seems to be some demand for them, but no satisfactory candidates. The following should work well even on Windows:
        (i) ocaml-top [4]: very basic GTK interface with a clean Windows installer, one-file editor with good OCaml support coupled with a top-level interface. I wrote this so I could improve on it if there is demand for it (e.g. add multi-file project management).
        (ii) ocamleditor [5]: a feature-full GTK IDE. Not sure how nice it is to use, but it looks a bit like Eclipse, has completion, documentation, module browser... Also includes its own basic build system. Not sure how it handles the toplevel.
        Has anyone tried them, or any other candidates ?

  The major work to do here is, I think, to handle a good setup for all above generic editors. By which I mean ocp-indent, merlin, coloration, etc. Otherwise, the issue is just deciding what editors to include.

So I'll get started on finding the best way to bundle editors setup ; and finding a good and customisable way to generate VM images.

Best,
Louis Gesbert

Indeed, we have been working for some time on improving Windows
support in the OcpWin distribution
(http://www.typerex.org/ocpwin.html), and we are interested by any
feedback on it.
Documentation is probably what is lacking behind, although the Github
pages should provide more information:
https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocpwin-distrib/blob/master/Readme.md

We haven't talked about it much, but there is also the ocp-webedit project:

http://edit.ocamlpro.com/

It is an online editor, with indentation and compilation. The version
on OCamlPro's server is the old version (bytecode compilation is done
in the browser, files are stored on OCamlPro's server, and there is
only support for Str, Unix and graphics libraries, with precompiled
runtimes for Linux, Mac and Windows), while the new version that was
done this summer by an intern is supposed to be installed on a
University's server, projects are stored there, and then compiled
remotely on this server, where OPAM can be used by the teacher to
choose the libraries available to students. We haven't had time to do
a proper release, but the code is available here:

Hello,
I had not enough time to reply before your summary, so I will react to it.

Teaching Caml at M2 level (3rd year Student of T?l?com Bretagne) in a language and compilation course.

My experiences:
- no real problem with using terminal for my students
- they are free to choose their editor, sublime text seems to be a common choice (except for the emacs / vi zealots)
- no real installation problem on their personal computer (a vast majority of linux and mac OS)
- installation on the school computers is more a pain because of the size the .opam repository, each student have a rather low disk quota (often they need to clean up their account before installing opam?)
- i use utop which is much better on the field of user interaction for the beginning and then we switch to ocamlbuild
- given the subject, we do not need anything really fancy (UI, audio, ?)
- we use mainly utop, menhir, merlin, ANSITerminal, ounit2, Batteries, ...

Things, I would love:
- being able to give them a sort of meta-package requiring a set of libraries
- perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exists but I haven?t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at the code of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). Why not also the doc?
- in utop, perhaps some integration with ocamlbuild (knowledge of _build, directive to relaunch ocamlbuild) and some support to read docs would makes it even greater
- I agree with everyone about error messages
- Student would appreciate a meta function for printing value (as the interpreter do) rather that writing a lot of function to do that...

I want to thanks everyone for the work done this two last because now the course is much more easier to teach since most of the previous technical difficulties have been solved. I think especially of opam, utop, menhir, ocaml.org <http://ocaml.org/>?

Thanks for the feedback!

It's possible to define one within a repository. Or, more directly, it should work to host an archive containing an `opam` file somewhere, and then have them run `opam pin URL`.
I'll check if that works and document it somewhere (OPAM FAQ?) if that turns out to be useful.

> - perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exists but I haven?t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at the code of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). Why not also the doc?
OPAM 1.2 added the `opam source <package>` command. Damn useful :)

Hope that helps!

I think a function of type 'a -> string is not going to happen without 
horrible hacks, however, you can take the deriving route by using either 
camlp4 + sexplib/deriving or ppx_deriving (with ocaml ?  4.02). The 
later is a bit easier to setup, since you avoid camlp4. However, If you 
already use camlp4 for other reasons, you can't use ppx.

I often observe that when someone is trying to dig up the source of a library,
chances are that that person will also benefit from having the cmt files and the
corresponding merlin support. So these days I just recommend everyone in our
research group to set OPAMKEEPBUILDDIR to "true" in order to retain the build
directory of every package installed by opam. I believe this would be highly
applicable in a classroom setting.

I thought it might be useful to split out the discussion on specific technologies.  Vagrant has come up several times, and it provides a useful mechanism to centralise not only the compiler distribution, but also editor tools and support infrastructure.

We'd like to provide a Vagrant distribution for our upcoming FP course in Cambridge next term [1].  We already have a Vagrant VM that combines OCaml with the MirageOS here: 

   https://github.com/mirage/mirage-vagrant-vms

I'm planning to split it out to make an OCaml-only base image.  If anyone has similar Vagrant setups that incorporate editor support and so on, I'd appreciate a pointer.  We're going to license our scripts under the CC0 public domain to make them as easily cut-and-pastable as possible.

There's a 'Vagrant Cloud' in beta that can host pointers to such images, and we're happy to host binary blobs, under a central 'ocaml' organisation if that's available.

+1 to Vagrant. It makes VM construction and distribution really simple. And
it makes it easy for all of us to share resources that go into VMs without
having to ship GBs of opaque images around.

Ben Greenman has already supplied a pointer to the Cornell CS 3110 Vagrant
scripts:

Speaking just for myself, I'd be very happy if this stayed roughly in sync
with Anil's efforts.
