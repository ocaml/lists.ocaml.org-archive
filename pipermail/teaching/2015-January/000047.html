<PRE>Just released 0.2 which should fix both issues (opam tuareg mode and stalling with vim)

&gt;<i> It would be good to know what we have there now.  It seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> minimum should be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - tuareg
</I>&gt;<i> - merlin
</I>&gt;<i> - ocp-indent
</I>&gt;<i> - utop
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> all read to go in emacs.  Getting vim and sublime text support would
</I>&gt;<i> be lovely too, but I think less critical.  What does user-setup
</I>&gt;<i> already support?
</I>
Needs more testing, but we do have those ; vim support also, but it's more lightly tested.
I didn't figure how to configure Sublime yet.

&gt;<i> Interesting. Concretely, what would would depext do in this context?
</I>&gt;<i> I did a fresh install of a number of packages on my mac, and I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> need much else, but I may have already had the dependencies in place
</I>&gt;<i> via brew.
</I>
Not sure, but you can use `opam depext -l` to simply show the currently required external packages.

The one that bites most often on .deb distributions is the lack of m4, which is required by ocamlfind. It gets much more complicated as soon as you want to install e.g. gtk stuff, of course (ocaml-top...).

Best,
Louis
