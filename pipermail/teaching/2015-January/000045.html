Indeed.  Now I think is the time to really focus on getting it
working, because this is the beginning of the semester, and so now is
the most valuable time to have something working cleanly.

It would be good to know what we have there now.  It seems like a
minimum should be:

- tuareg
- merlin
- ocp-indent
- utop

all read to go in emacs.  Getting vim and sublime text support would
be lovely too, but I think less critical.  What does user-setup
already support?

&gt;<i> The idea, with this and the &quot;depext&quot; package is to have a setup that can be limited to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     PACKAGES=&quot;user-setup merlin utop cohttp js_of_ocaml oasis ocp-indent ocp-index ssl core_extended async js_of_ocaml core_bench cohttp cryptokit menhir&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     opam init -a
</I>&gt;<i>     opam install depext
</I>&gt;<i>     opam depext $PACKAGES
</I>&gt;<i>     opam install $PACKAGES
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and results in a ready-to-go environment. This is in particular targetted at VM setup, of course.
</I>
Interesting. Concretely, what would would depext do in this context?
I did a fresh install of a number of packages on my mac, and I didn't
need much else, but I may have already had the dependencies in place
via brew.

Greg, it's also probably a good idea to encourage your students to
upgrade to the latest opam if they're on a mac.  Homebrew is pretty
lightweight, and has opam 1.2.0.
