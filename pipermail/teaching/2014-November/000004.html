</I>&gt;<i> 1/ What systems does it need to work in ? Does that include Windows ?
</I>

For the functional programming course at Cornell, we dropped Windows
support in favor of a vagrant vm [1] in Fall 2013 and have since been much
happier. Students can just double-click a few things and have a working
install (complete with extra packages like pa_ounit and qcheck), and staff
no longer needs to worry about cross-platform issues (especially important
for GUIs).
