<PRE>Thanks for the feedback!

&gt;<i> Things, I would love:
</I>&gt;<i> - being able to give them a sort of meta-package requiring a set of libraries
</I>It's possible to define one within a repository. Or, more directly, it should work to host an archive containing an `opam` file somewhere, and then have them run `opam pin URL`.
I'll check if that works and document it somewhere (OPAM FAQ?) if that turns out to be useful.

&gt;<i> - perhaps some support to get access to the sources (perhaps it exists but I haven&#8217;t seen it), sometimes I push them into looking at the code of the libraries and they need to get it (or browse github). Why not also the doc?
</I>OPAM 1.2 added the `opam source &lt;package&gt;` command. Damn useful :)

Hope that helps!
