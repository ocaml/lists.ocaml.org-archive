<PRE>
&gt;<i> - Student would appreciate a meta function for printing value (as the 
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter do) rather that writing a lot of function to do that...
</I>I think a function of type 'a -&gt; string is not going to happen without 
horrible hacks, however, you can take the deriving route by using either 
camlp4 + sexplib/deriving or ppx_deriving (with ocaml &#8805;  4.02). The 
later is a bit easier to setup, since you avoid camlp4. However, If you 
already use camlp4 for other reasons, you can't use ppx.
