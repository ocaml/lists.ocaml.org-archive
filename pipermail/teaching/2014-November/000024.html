I often observe that when someone is trying to dig up the source of a library,
chances are that that person will also benefit from having the cmt files and the
corresponding merlin support. So these days I just recommend everyone in our
research group to set OPAMKEEPBUILDDIR to &quot;true&quot; in order to retain the build
directory of every package installed by opam. I believe this would be highly
applicable in a classroom setting.
