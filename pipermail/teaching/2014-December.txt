On how to provide a set of libraries to install, the following is on its way to the FAQ:

?
### Easily provide a set of packages for students to install

The easiest way is to create a package with your prerequisites as `depends` and
have them pin that. A quick way to host the file is to use a
[Gist](https://gist.github.com). Create one with minimal contents and listing
your packages as dependencies -- the file name **has** to be `opam`:

```
opam-version: "1.2"
name: "ocaml101"
version: "0.1"
maintainer: "Louis Gesbert <louis.gesbert at ocamlpro.com>"
depends: [ "menhir" { = "20140422" }
           "merlin" { >= "2" }
           "ocp-indent"
           "ocp-index" ]
```

Save that and get the `HTTPS clone URL`. All that is needed then is to run:

```shell
$ opam pin add ocaml101 <HTTPS clone URL>
```

Furthermore, `opam update` will then pick up any modification you made to the gist.
?

Cheers,
Louis

This seems like a great little howto.  Should we perhaps have a teaching
FAQ on ocaml.org and put bits of advice like this in there?

Having a FAQ with a list of questions/how-tos and links to "answers" would
be terrific for me.  There have already been a couple of "how-tos" in this
email thread vis-a-vis setting up Merlin better.

Agreed.  I think it's important not to scatter all this information too much as we assemble it though.

Putting all of this in the central OPAM FAQ first (perhaps with categories) will give us one place to point to, and we could then create a more domain-specific teaching page with links into to the FAQ.  I would, for example, also like to link into the central OPAM FAQ from the MirageOS site as well.

Since this is for teaching, and we already have a teaching page [1], I'd expect this information to be available from there.

I suggest the following:

- The general question of how you make a collection of packages available could go on the OPAM FAQ -- it's not just for students (so I'd change the title).

- Additional information, on the use-case for teaching, is added to the teaching page. Ideally, with a brief example/link of how a course has used it.
