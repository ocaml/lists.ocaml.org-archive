Wouldn't a simple list of contributors be enough ? Or should we really
investigate and measure the size of contributions ? How do you compare
the time I spent convincing people OPAM should be done, finding funds
and manpower, with the time other ones spent developing or
contributing packages ?

&gt;<i> I was not involved in the DORM project so I don't know that part of the story

??? You were working for OCamlPro, and spending some of your time
managing Frederic (with me), who was paid by DORM via INRIA. You may
not have been involved in the administrative part of DORM, but you
were clearly involved in the technical part :-)

In the attached file, I tracked the number of OPAM packages after
every commit in the first months (I hope I didn't make any mistake):

&gt;<i>From 6 Aug 2012 to 14 Aug 2012, Frederic added 100 packages in about
</I>15 commits (count 115 to 214). On 12 Jul 2012, he added 19 packages
(count 82 to 101). Just with that, he is the main contributor of
packages at end of August 2012 with more than half the packages. In my
souvenir, he was mostly working on packaging while you were mostly
developing the tool itself.

Funnily, my own contribution was to move the count from 24 to... 0 and
then 1 on Jun 5 :-)
