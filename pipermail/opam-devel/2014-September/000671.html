&gt;<i> Thanks. I now have it working on Ubuntu. The issue is that several OS packages have to be installed, not just &quot;ocaml&quot; and &quot;camlp4&quot;. Thus, the instructions [1,2] we've been linking people to are incomplete.

That's right -- this has always been the case historically on Debian (somewhat suboptimally I think, but it fits in with their distribution criteria).  I usually do &quot;ocaml ocaml-native-compilers camlp4-extra&quot; to get everything.

&gt;<i>

</I>
You should have got ocamldoc with just ocaml there.  I believe you just need &quot;ocaml&quot; and &quot;ocaml-camlp4&quot; on CentOS, but please correct me if that's wrong.  I don't regularly use it and so could have missed something in the packaging.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why are multiple packages needed? I would expect &quot;apt-get install ocaml&quot; or &quot;yum install ocaml&quot; to install everything that one gets from installing the source distribution of OCaml.

That's just following upstream packaging practises.  I think it's better to do that and to document what packages are needed, rather than changing it for our local efforts.

However, it could be easier.  I'll take a look at making the Travis scripts a bit more automated by sourcing a central copy of the script from somewhere on GitHub.  That'll reduce the rate of cut and pastes..
