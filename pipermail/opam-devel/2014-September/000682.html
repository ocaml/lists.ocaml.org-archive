That's very interesting -- is there a central repository of Maven package
metadata as well that?  I thought it was a standalone build tool.  It would
be very useful to have some sort of comparison to other languages to get a
sense of how well we're doing (even if it's a very rough metric).

I guess if we're going to do more work on OCaml Java then we need to start
poking at the Java packaging ecosystem.  I'm not terribly eager :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DORM's outcome on the OCaml side is indeed opam: if you dig into opam's git

</I>&gt;<i> answering questions and solving issues with the algorithms, which is sadly

</I>
Yeah, this aspect is very important.  The git repository is just a guideline;
there were many IRC and personal conversations that drove the early design.
We can just iterate on the history until everyone's happy, and then maintain
it moving forward every few months when new features show up.
