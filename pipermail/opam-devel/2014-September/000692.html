Why don't we just do that with a mechanized pass of the repository to rewrite packages to add the `available` field when missing?  It's also clearer to the user if there's an available field in the immediate package description, instead of having to invoke `opam` to perform the dependency resolution.  That wouldn't require any changes to ows either.

Although, now that I think about it more, one big downside is that the `available` field may become out-of-date when a *new* version of a dependency is added, such as this one today in Batteries [1] that tweaks `available` versions.  We would have to then adjust all the upstream `available` packages also, which seems rather error prone.

[1] <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/2779">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/2779</A>

I'm CCing Damien Doligez, since he's been fixing a huge number of these issues in the OPAM repository recently, and is cooking up some tools to help with OCaml release engineering.  Roberto, is the source (even if it's not very clean) to ows available for us to experiment locally?  I'd prefer not to duplicate efforts between Damien, us and you if possible, but I also don't want to cause you extra work if OWS isn't easily re-installable.
