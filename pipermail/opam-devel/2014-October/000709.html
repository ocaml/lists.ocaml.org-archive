<PRE>Thanks !

Yes, I should have submitted them earlier. More details on why the need for them arose:

1. That one may not be strictly needed anymore: at some point we wanted to check the solver version by first trying with advanced criteria, then falling back to more basic ones in case of error. The issue was that after the solver call failed, raising an exception, the timer would still be set, which would make the next call fail with this assert.

2. Hm, really should have done this earlier, I'll need to look it up but I _did_ get to a case where I wanted more info on the conflicts and this check prevented me from getting the conflict information. I'll find you the precise case.

3. OPAM already includes functions for running external commands, with logging, signal handling, etc. It's nicer from our side to be able to call the solver command consistently with the same functions and error handling. The different way to handle signals already proved a problem a couple times. Also, we were trying to achieve more compatibility between different solvers, and adding a layer at that point may get handy ; this could also be used to send a query to the solver farm, without any external command.

Cheers,
Louis
