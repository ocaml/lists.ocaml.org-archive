</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  The Coq theorem prover is facing the same challenges as OCaml to distribute and share its contributions. OPAM is a successful initiative for OCaml, so we would be pleased to use it as well. Thanks for this software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Things are still in development and not publicly released, but here are what we have for Coq:

</I>&gt;<i> * four repositories:

Nice!

&gt;<i>  Something we wonder is how to prevent name collisions with the OCaml packages. Some kind of namespace would be the solution. As a convention, we propose to use the &quot;:&quot; separator, like in Docker. So a package on the Coq repository would be of name: &quot;coq:ssreflect&quot; instead of just &quot;ssreflect&quot;. We could go even further and use the &quot;coq:big-project-name:small-part-of-it&quot; scheme for big projects.
</I>
Sounds sensible to me.  I'd probably keep the : convention unambiguous though.  You can also use the 'tags' field mark Coq packages specifically.  This will let you merge remotes with OCaml and still filter to Coq-only packages.

 
&gt;<i>  Do you think it is a good practice and will the &quot;:&quot; symbol remain handled in names by OPAM? Could we reserve the &quot;coq:&quot; prefix on the OCaml repo to make sure no one is allowed to publish a package with this prefix?
</I>
Sure; by 'reserve', the repository mergers will flag up any Coq packages to you before taking any action.  Is there a mailing list for the Coq/OPAM effort?  You're welcome to continue to use this one from my perspective...

What sort of automated testing would be useful for you?  We have a growing amount of infrastructure that does automatic building, but triaging errors is the current bottleneck.

Louis had some prototype code for compilers-as-packages that may help improve this integration in the future.  For now though, OPAM 1.2 looks good for your needs with some careful metadata management, I think.
