I've reviewed the three patches Roberto sent to me this morning.

- &quot;Remove broken assert&quot;
  I merged this one. Do you have a quick example ? I can imagine that
  this could happen, but I cannot think of anything concrete...

- &quot;Removed hard failure cases, in favour of finer diagnostics&quot; 
  I've NOT merged this one. The globalid variable is used internally.
  It is a fake package identifier that is only used to encode global
  constraints on the universe. It is indeed a fatal error to use this
  globalid otherwise. I cannot see why it should be missing or you
  should have another package to conflict with this id. Maybe you can
  convince me with an example how this could happen ...

- &quot;Add a check_request function allowing more control over the
  underlying process&quot;
  I merged this one. What kind of finer control do you need on the
  solver sub-process ? Maybe we can also generalize the function 
  CudfSolver.execsolver ?

These two patches are now merged in dose/master.

Thank you for these patches. Maybe next time, for a faster feedback,
you could post them directly on the dose development mailing list[1]. I
track opam-devel, but sometimes I miss one message or an other.
