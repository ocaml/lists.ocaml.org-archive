<PRE>Ok. Before modifying the document, I would like to suggest the
following overview:

1/ The Ancestors of OPAM (GODI and so on)
2/ The Foundations of OPAM (gathering several teams to work on OPAM)
3/ The Birth of OPAM (first implementations)
4/ The Rise of OPAM (first release and current situation)

Also, I would like to put some stress on the 4 main differences
between GODI and OPAM, as I see them. The 4 short-comings of GODI I
see that are fixed by OPAM are:
- sub-optimal installation solutions =&gt; use of CUDF/Dose
- complex user interface =&gt; simple &quot;&#224; la apt&quot; interface
- complex repository management =&gt; simple github-based workflow
- no automatic Q/A on the repository =&gt; Travis + OWS

What do you think ?

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think that's right -- it was just the descriptions and metadata
</I>&gt;<i> that were borrowed from GODI, with the build instructions being manually
</I>&gt;<i> edited to add (e.g.) the prefix and make macros.  That was quite a bit of
