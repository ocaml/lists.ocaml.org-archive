</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attached you find many new OCaml ports. Mainly the following two and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their dependencies:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Oasis (an OCaml project build and metadata tool) used by many of our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  OCaml ports.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Janestreet Core standard library overlay and Janestreet Async
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Oasis depends on devel/janestreet/ocaml-type_conv while most of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> janestreet stuff uses oasis. If this is too much, I could leave the rest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of janestreet for now and only import ocaml-type_conv.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since I'm currently waiting for the release of OPAM 1.2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/sysutils/opam">https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/sysutils/opam</A>),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which can be used to install all those libraries and binaries, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wondering whether it still makes any sense to maintain those ports in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> our ports tree. The same applies to other ports already in our tree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like devel/{utop,ocaml-lambda-term,ocaml-lwt} ...). Opinions? OKs?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Christopher
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Personally I would prefer to use opam over ports. The only reason I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can see for maintaining ports is if they are needed to build other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ocaml ports (mldonkey?) in the tree. That's my 0.05C (Canada has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eliminated the penny).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .... Ken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess we would also need a port when upstream needs patches to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compile on OpenBSD. Hopefully a rare situation going forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to merge OpenBSD-specific fixes into OPAM -- it's possible to
</I>&gt;<i> add OS-specific selectors in the patches field to not affect other OSes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is very convenient to be able to depend on a binary
</I>&gt;<i> installation of OCaml libraries for end-user applications, particularly
</I>&gt;<i> given the strict versioning requirements.  The OpenBSD port is also
</I>&gt;<i> higher quality when it comes to architecture portability, since it
</I>&gt;<i> separates out bytecode vs native code vs native dynlinking architectures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is enough metadata available in an OPAM package to generate a
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot of OpenBSD ports from a given package set.  I'm not suggesting
</I>&gt;<i> we automatically import the results into OpenBSD, but it would really
</I>&gt;<i> help keep the ports tree in sync with the latest versions of libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> The metadata needed for this is roughly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - build instructions -- present in OPAM, but they do not separate out
</I>&gt;<i>   fake installation and native code at the moment.  This could be added
</I>&gt;<i>   to OPAM fairly easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - external dependencies -- OPAM has a 'depexts' field where OS packages
</I>&gt;<i>   can be specified.  This is a free-form field, so it could be a precise
</I>&gt;<i>   pkgspec for the OpenBSD entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - categories and homepages -- these can be lifted straight out of the
</I>&gt;<i>   OPAM spec, and tags can be used to map OpenBSD-specific information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More broadly though, does any other language-specific packaging system
</I>&gt;<i> do this at the moment, or all ports maintained manually?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -anil
</I>
IANA porter, so I speak only from a user perspective. And I don't use
any perl ports so I don't know if they represent all perl ports used
on OpenBSD or just those needed OpenBSD specific tweaks.

If there are OpenBSD specific patches needed then I think a port is
the way to go. I'd hate to have a lot of info kept in opam only to
find Oxford has kidnapped Anil on boat race night and is demanding the
OpenBSD Ocaml community cough up. :-)

I currently have no idea how many OpenBSD patches are needed. The
couple I found while playing with getting core_extended working were
fixed by OpenBSD commits or are in queue to get fixed in core_extended
(right, Anil?). The other packages I needed/wanted to try all worked
from the wip opam 1.2 port.

My two minor concerns are 1) making sure RWO readers find OpenBSD a
congenial place to follow along, and 2) making sure that opam and
ports can co-exist if opam is available on OpenBSD.

In regards to 2), I encountered confusion when I had utop port
installed and then also blithely installed it with opam. Not to say it
is certain that I didn't screw up something just on my system, but the
relations between the two should be well known/easily discovered.
