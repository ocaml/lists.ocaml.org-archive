Subject: [opam-devel] OCaml (4.09) test failure
Message-ID: <CAK5_-8po+sfscRi0RrNrHoDA3G2CU_dfnKF5wLYRj-aQUVtX1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

 The OCaml tests have one failure on macOS 10.13 and I don't if this
 is a known issue or possibly something is wrong in my installation.
 So, I'm not sure if this problem should be reported and how, ie at:
 https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues

 The failed test is this:
   tests/output-complete-obj/'test.ml'
   with 1.2.1.1 [testing 'test.ml' with 1.2.1.1]

 Summary:
 2473 passed,
     33 skipped,
       1 failed,
     94 not started,
       0 unexpected errors,
 2601 considered.

 Is the above a known or unknown issue, or possibly some problem in my
 installation?

 Thanks in advance,
 Ev. Drikos
