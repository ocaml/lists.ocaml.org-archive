<PRE>This has now been merged, and the rewritten repository at <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev">https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev</A> (to which opam 2 is automatically redirected) is updated accordingly.

This means that anyone testing a 2.0~alpha development version (thanks!) will need to upgrade their opam when they want to do `opam update`. Thanks for your understanding, and enjoy the new version!


&gt;<i> - Louis Gesbert, 18/07/2016 15:34 -
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We finally have a solution that I find satisfying to the larger blocker we had 
</I>&gt;<i> with opam 2.0 &#8212; inconsistency of the use of `available:` fields based on a 
</I>&gt;<i> variable `ocaml-version` that couldn't be known before the `ocaml` package was 
</I>&gt;<i> installed. See below if you are interested in the details, I have said a few 
</I>&gt;<i> words about it here and there, but a summary is in order.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With this, and after a little bit more testing, I think we should be done with 
</I>&gt;<i> the large repository format changes and rewrites, and that alone is a good 
</I>&gt;<i> reason to release the too-long-awaited successor of 1.2.2. Adding the many, 
</I>&gt;<i> smaller and larger features you're all waiting for (local switches, per-switch 
</I>&gt;<i> remotes, etc., etc.) from there should be smoother and can be done 
</I>&gt;<i> incrementally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For all users and testers of 2.0~alpha &#8212; thank you &#8212; the alpha2 changes the 
</I>&gt;<i> repository layout a bit, so when I merge and put the new repository rewrite in 
</I>&gt;<i> place on <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev,">https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev,</A> you will need to update your version 
</I>&gt;<i> of opam (I don't want to spend time on maintaining repo mirrors at different 
</I>&gt;<i> dev versions, not counting the issues that might arise on the older versions).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I think we should release opam 2.0 while the default repository is still 
</I>&gt;<i> an automatic rewrite of the 1.2 repository; then, take the time to put a 
</I>&gt;<i> reverse rewrite in place (the 1.2&#8594;2.0 rewrite is far from trivial, changing 
</I>&gt;<i> .comp to opam files, rewriting variables, changing formulas on variables into 
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies on packages, so this won't be easy). Once this is done, automatic 
</I>&gt;<i> testing follows and enough people have made the move, we can independently 
</I>&gt;<i> switch the format of the official opam-repository to 2.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now for the technical details. The upcoming dev version creates 4 distinct 
</I>&gt;<i> `ocaml` packages:
</I>&gt;<i> - `ocaml-system`: an OCaml compiler from the system, outside of opam. There is 
</I>&gt;<i> an instance of the package for every OCaml release.
</I>&gt;<i> - `ocaml-base-compiler`: the &quot;official&quot; releases of OCaml, compiled from 
</I>&gt;<i> source by opam, with the corresponding version
</I>&gt;<i> - `ocaml-variants`: a single package for all &quot;other&quot; versions of OCaml, built 
</I>&gt;<i> by opam. The package versions have the form `OCAML_VERSION+VARIANT`, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> `4.02.3+fp`
</I>&gt;<i> - `ocaml`: a wrapper package that depends on one of the first three, for each 
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml release, mapping the versions in the case of `ocaml-variants`. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, `ocaml.4.03.3` depends on `ocaml-system{=4.02.3} | ocaml-base-
</I>&gt;<i> compiler{=4.02.3} | ocaml-variants{&gt;=4.02.3 &amp; &lt;4.02.4~}`. Additionally, the 
</I>&gt;<i> package runs an (ocaml) script that detects the specifics of the OCaml 
</I>&gt;<i> version, initialising package variables such as `ocaml:native-dynlink`&#185;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of the first three are mutually conflicting, which is the reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> keeping all variants in a single package&#178;. Any constraints on the OCaml 
</I>&gt;<i> version should now be expressed through a dependency to the `ocaml` package 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the `available:` field.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To this point, this leaves us with the matter of the &quot;system&quot; compilers, which 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be selected manually. To this end, the following provides a nice 
</I>&gt;<i> solution, that doesn't rely on any OCaml-specific mechanism:
</I>&gt;<i> - support for &quot;global&quot; (i.e. not per-switch) opam variables, defined in 
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.opam/config, is added
</I>&gt;<i> - ~/.opam/config has a field that allows to initialise those (lazily) from the 
</I>&gt;<i> output of a command (if the command fails or doesn't exist, the variable is 
</I>&gt;<i> simply left uninitialised)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on this, we define, in the configuration file, an `ocaml-sys-version` 
</I>&gt;<i> global variable bound to the output of `ocamlc -vnum`. Then we add a 
</I>&gt;<i> constraint `available: ocaml-sys-version = _:version` to the `ocaml-system` 
</I>&gt;<i> package. This way, only the installable ocaml-system package is visible, and 
</I>&gt;<i> additionally, if it changes, existing opam mechanisms will trigger an up/down-
</I>&gt;<i> grade to the correct version. Also, still using existing mechanisms, `opam 
</I>&gt;<i> switch ocaml-system` will pick the right version, while `opam switch 4.02.3` 
</I>&gt;<i> will either pick `ocaml-base-compiler` (if `ocaml-system.4.02.3` is not 
</I>&gt;<i> available) or state that the choice is ambiguous and ask to choose between 
</I>&gt;<i> `ocaml-system` and `ocaml-base-compiler` otherwise. In case the variable is 
</I>&gt;<i> not properly defined, the `ocaml-system` package won't be available, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> won't break anything besides.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We also extend the way in which such a variable can be initially defined in 
</I>&gt;<i> opam, by supporting an `init` file (e.g. ~/.opamrc or /etc/opamrc) that allows 
</I>&gt;<i> to choose, at `opam init` time, many ~/.opam/config options and e.g. the 
</I>&gt;<i> initial repositories to use. Opam has a default, built-in init file that binds 
</I>&gt;<i> to <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org">https://opam.ocaml.org</A> and defines `ocaml-sys-version`, but this is better 
</I>&gt;<i> separated from the code, and easier to override, than before. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this all makes sense, comments welcome. All of this is already working, 
</I>&gt;<i> with the proper automatic rewrites, and just needs a little more polish before 
</I>&gt;<i> merging into master.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Louis
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#185; Contrary to before, this never becomes a global variable and can be used in 
</I>&gt;<i> commands but never in the `available:` field.
</I>&gt;<i> &#178; The `provides:` field would be a more elegant solution to this, but causes 
</I>&gt;<i> more problem than it solves; design work to have it in opam has advanced &#8212; 
</I>&gt;<i> it's yet desirable for many reasons &#8212; but let's keep matters separate.
</I></PRE>
