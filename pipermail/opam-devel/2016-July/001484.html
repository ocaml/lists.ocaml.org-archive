<PRE>Hi all,

We finally have a solution that I find satisfying to the larger blocker we had 
with opam 2.0 &#8212; inconsistency of the use of `available:` fields based on a 
variable `ocaml-version` that couldn't be known before the `ocaml` package was 
installed. See below if you are interested in the details, I have said a few 
words about it here and there, but a summary is in order.

With this, and after a little bit more testing, I think we should be done with 
the large repository format changes and rewrites, and that alone is a good 
reason to release the too-long-awaited successor of 1.2.2. Adding the many, 
smaller and larger features you're all waiting for (local switches, per-switch 
remotes, etc., etc.) from there should be smoother and can be done 
incrementally.

For all users and testers of 2.0~alpha &#8212; thank you &#8212; the alpha2 changes the 
repository layout a bit, so when I merge and put the new repository rewrite in 
place on <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev,">https://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev,</A> you will need to update your version 
of opam (I don't want to spend time on maintaining repo mirrors at different 
dev versions, not counting the issues that might arise on the older versions).

Also, I think we should release opam 2.0 while the default repository is still 
an automatic rewrite of the 1.2 repository; then, take the time to put a 
reverse rewrite in place (the 1.2&#8594;2.0 rewrite is far from trivial, changing 
.comp to opam files, rewriting variables, changing formulas on variables into 
dependencies on packages, so this won't be easy). Once this is done, automatic 
testing follows and enough people have made the move, we can independently 
switch the format of the official opam-repository to 2.0.


---

Now for the technical details. The upcoming dev version creates 4 distinct 
`ocaml` packages:
- `ocaml-system`: an OCaml compiler from the system, outside of opam. There is 
an instance of the package for every OCaml release.
- `ocaml-base-compiler`: the &quot;official&quot; releases of OCaml, compiled from 
source by opam, with the corresponding version
- `ocaml-variants`: a single package for all &quot;other&quot; versions of OCaml, built 
by opam. The package versions have the form `OCAML_VERSION+VARIANT`, e.g. 
`4.02.3+fp`
- `ocaml`: a wrapper package that depends on one of the first three, for each 
OCaml release, mapping the versions in the case of `ocaml-variants`. For 
example, `ocaml.4.03.3` depends on `ocaml-system{=4.02.3} | ocaml-base-
compiler{=4.02.3} | ocaml-variants{&gt;=4.02.3 &amp; &lt;4.02.4~}`. Additionally, the 
package runs an (ocaml) script that detects the specifics of the OCaml 
version, initialising package variables such as `ocaml:native-dynlink`&#185;.

All of the first three are mutually conflicting, which is the reason for 
keeping all variants in a single package&#178;. Any constraints on the OCaml 
version should now be expressed through a dependency to the `ocaml` package 
instead of the `available:` field.

To this point, this leaves us with the matter of the &quot;system&quot; compilers, which 
need to be selected manually. To this end, the following provides a nice 
solution, that doesn't rely on any OCaml-specific mechanism:
- support for &quot;global&quot; (i.e. not per-switch) opam variables, defined in 
~/.opam/config, is added
- ~/.opam/config has a field that allows to initialise those (lazily) from the 
output of a command (if the command fails or doesn't exist, the variable is 
simply left uninitialised)

Based on this, we define, in the configuration file, an `ocaml-sys-version` 
global variable bound to the output of `ocamlc -vnum`. Then we add a 
constraint `available: ocaml-sys-version = _:version` to the `ocaml-system` 
package. This way, only the installable ocaml-system package is visible, and 
additionally, if it changes, existing opam mechanisms will trigger an up/down-
grade to the correct version. Also, still using existing mechanisms, `opam 
switch ocaml-system` will pick the right version, while `opam switch 4.02.3` 
will either pick `ocaml-base-compiler` (if `ocaml-system.4.02.3` is not 
available) or state that the choice is ambiguous and ask to choose between 
`ocaml-system` and `ocaml-base-compiler` otherwise. In case the variable is 
not properly defined, the `ocaml-system` package won't be available, but it 
won't break anything besides.

We also extend the way in which such a variable can be initially defined in 
opam, by supporting an `init` file (e.g. ~/.opamrc or /etc/opamrc) that allows 
to choose, at `opam init` time, many ~/.opam/config options and e.g. the 
initial repositories to use. Opam has a default, built-in init file that binds 
to <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org">https://opam.ocaml.org</A> and defines `ocaml-sys-version`, but this is better 
separated from the code, and easier to override, than before. 


Hope this all makes sense, comments welcome. All of this is already working, 
with the proper automatic rewrites, and just needs a little more polish before 
merging into master.

Best,
Louis


&#185; Contrary to before, this never becomes a global variable and can be used in 
commands but never in the `available:` field.
&#178; The `provides:` field would be a more elegant solution to this, but causes 
more problem than it solves; design work to have it in opam has advanced &#8212; 
it's yet desirable for many reasons &#8212; but let's keep matters separate.
