utils/config.mlp shows that the output will be the CCOMPTYPE variable OCaml was configured with; config/Makefile.{msvc,msvc64,mingw,mingw64} show that is &quot;msvc&quot; for the first two and &quot;cc&quot; for the second two.

</I>
That looks an abuse to me! The operating system for all four ports is Win32 (yes, it may sound strange that the OS for a 64-bit port is also Win32, but that's actually how the parlance works and isn't unique to OCaml...). The operating system for the Cygwin ports is *not* Windows, hence the different output.

Additionally, while new code out there may be taking advantage of Sys.win32, I expect there's a lot of code still reasonably expecting that Sys.os_type = &quot;Win32&quot; will work forever. Adding Sys.comp_type would be handy, of course... but then having the entire Config module as Sys.Config would be generally quite useful!

&gt;<i> However I would like to get feedback from windows users if it makes sense

</I>&gt;<i> build-wise with mingw compared to a plain win32 and that it's useful in

</I>&gt;<i> `ocamlc -config`. Because if it's only for the file extension business
</I>&gt;<i> maybe it's not such a good idea to define an os value for it.
</I>
I'm not sure what you're getting at here - what build system differences are you referring to?
