<PRE>Daniel, would you be opposed to a CLA if the code were released under a
more liberal license?  For our open source code, Jane Street was advised to
use a CLA, even though we were using a liberal license (Apache, in
particular.)  I'm curious if the CLA itself is a problem, or just the CLA
in combination with a restrictive license?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being there at the beginning, I understand the initial choice of license:
</I>&gt;<i> at the time, the scope of what was being building was not totally clear,
</I>&gt;<i> opam was the first large independent software project developed by OCamlPro
</I>&gt;<i> the company was very young and some kind of protection were needed.
</I>&gt;<i> Nowadays, I think opam is in a very different different situation: it
</I>&gt;<i> became the default package manager for OCaml.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd rather look at the next steps at how we can now make opam more
</I>&gt;<i> widespread. For instance,  lower the contribution barrier: simpler and more
</I>&gt;<i> re-usable code, more documentation, simpler licensing scheme (BSD is the
</I>&gt;<i> new norm); and  make it fully OCaml independent: in the source code but
</I>&gt;<i> also in the manual, and on its own website (generated from GH pages, with
</I>&gt;<i> manual + roadmap). Lastly, we need all which was discussed on the roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> for 1.3, including windows support :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Le lundi, 18 janvier 2016 &#224; 19:09, Louis Gesbert a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; By having a CLA in place, we ensure we have the hands free to avoid any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; further such issues: the problem can't arise again. Yes, it does allow
</I>&gt;<i> us to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; re-license the software, or even negociate specific licensing terms with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; partners, which sounds quite fair to me. Also, this adds to the range of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; theoretical possibilities, but we currently have no plans to monetize
</I>&gt;<i> Opam.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So let's be honest about it. From the community point of view there are
</I>&gt;<i> very little incentives to this solution. License changes are rare.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am curious and would be glad to hear more about it: I intuitively
</I>&gt;<i> don't see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; much difference between submitting a contribution BSD-licensed or under
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; terms of the CLA, from the company's point of view. Am I wrong ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Opam is LGPL'ed, contributing under the terms of the CLA allows OCamlPro
</I>&gt;<i> to do whatever it wishes with opam and the contributions. But you as a
</I>&gt;<i> contributor are not allowed to do whatever you wish since you are bound by
</I>&gt;<i> LGPL terms. If Opam was under a more liberal license, everyone could do
</I>&gt;<i> whatever it wishes with the code and we'd no even need to have a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> about a CLA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also from a broader perspective, companies may have rules that say you
</I>&gt;<i> are allowed to contribute to projects that have these specific kind of
</I>&gt;<i> licenses. Having other legalities under the form of CLAs surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> contribution may be a no go because the legal setting is non standard or
</I>&gt;<i> would need to much legal investigations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Daniel
