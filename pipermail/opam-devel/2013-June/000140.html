&gt;<i> One thing that would be very nice would be to have a flag in opam switch where you could just specify a subversion revision (or, failing that, a github one) of trunk to build.  It would make it easier and simpler for people to try out things at specific patchlevels and report bugs based on them.  I was thinking about this because of some recent feedback I gave on mantis that was a bit vague on the specific compiler version in question, because I didn't really know.

Yeah, this would be useful.  The current compiler specs could do this with a little bit of environment variable or macro help. I've moved this to:
