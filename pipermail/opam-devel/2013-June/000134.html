</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if an upstream opam-repository-unstable makes sense here, which always points to the bleeding-edge version of a package. This would also be useful for OCamlot to test, although very prone to breakage. @dsheets, any thoughts on this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that would really help as long as there is no mechanism by which a package can somehow auto-update its own description when it changes. That's the problem, not accessing the bleeding edge source, opam pin handles that very well.
</I>
The unstable repository I'm thinking of also has its OPAM description, url and information file.  The only difference from unstable to stable is that <A HREF="git://">git://</A> URLs are allowed in the unstable repository.

This is similar to the xen-org repository at <A HREF="http://github.com/xen-org/opam-repo-dev,">http://github.com/xen-org/opam-repo-dev,</A> which they use for cutting-edge packages.  The danger of such a repository is that people neglect to test their stable tree, but OCamlot should help with that when it goes live.

&gt;<i> I think there's a use case that is not well covered here, which is pre-release/blocking bug in a package. What you really want is pin a package to the git repo but maybe only for a few days (like I wanted with ocp-indent), but of course the repos may not have the correct build instructions, so you want a lightweight way of being able to specify the new ones. For me it seems natural to try to lookup that in the repo itself.
</I>
In general, it's preferable to separate the packaging from the sources since they change at different rates.  For instance, Debian packages recommend the same thing:
<A HREF="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues/149#issuecomment-16041625">https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues/149#issuecomment-16041625</A>

But the point remains that you can't just blindly pin a git repo to the bleeding edge in many cases, as it has some other dependencies that are also pulled in.  Why not just make it easier to apply a local patch to one (stable) package description?  That way you guarantee that you have all the prerequisites.

A script could do this easily: grab the latest stable description for a particular package, and create a remote with a slightly bumped version number (e.g. -local1 suffixed) and add a patch to the files/ directory.  When the upstream package is released, its higher version number will naturally take precedence.  No pinning required.

(Either way, I'd record your use case as a bug on the OPAM tracker to ensure we don't forget this conversation).
