Even the notion of repo maintainer is weird: we should target a completely
distributed repo, where each package is taken care of by a small set of
maintainers (as it is done in Debian, which is not perfect, but working).

Imagine if Github decided that, as they are at least as smart as the devs
who use their platform, that they should have the right to patch whatever
code is hosted on Github. Would you keep using such a platform ? I think
it's the same here: I don't want anybody to mess with my packages, but I do
want to be warned if there is a problem that I should fix.

I think the opam repo maintainers have one opportunity to fix packages
(when a new version is submitted the first time), but then, they should not
be permitted to modify them anymore, without the permission of the
submitter.

It is indeed important that upstream are aware of issue and we currently do
&gt;<i> a poor job with that. Would be nice to automatise that by sending emails to
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers. Anil, can we use @ocaml.org's SMTP for that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What are you proposing ? Indeed, we should have a daemon watching the
repository and sending automated emails for some kind of simple problems.


&gt;<i> * a maintainer's fix might be of less quality than an owner's fix, because
</I>&gt;<i> he might not know why something is done or not done. Discussing with the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After having spend years (literally) fixing issues in opam-repository, I
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with that statement. Repo maintainers are experienced OCaml coder,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, if your goal is to spend more and more time fixing problems in the
repo, that's probably the best approach. But if you want to move the work
from the repo maintainers to the package maintainers, then you need to
spend a little more time communicating with them about such issues. I think
the strict approach is better to spread knowledge, and thus on the long
term. And automatisation can help a lot !


&gt;<i> I think the current model has some flows but it's still very valid given
</I>&gt;<i> the current constraints. As I said in an other thread, this is a local
</I>&gt;<i> optimum. Of course, I'm fine to move to another local optimum if it's
</I>&gt;<i> better :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, let's find a better local optimum :-)
