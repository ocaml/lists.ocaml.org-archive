<PRE>The traffic is already a nuisance! Commenting on your previous rebuttal:

&gt;<i> Well, as I am watching tens of repos on Github, my mailbox is full of such emails.
</I>
That&#8217;s a problem with your mail client configuration, not the process!

&gt;<i> I would not notice such a mention, unless I decide to read the thread because the title is interesting.
</I>
GitHub sets lots of headers &#8211; standard list ones in a predictable manner for each repo &#8211; and also some useful extra ones (I use them to filter out some other very high activity repos). In particular, watching for X-GitHub-Reason: mention allows you to mark as high priority (or whatever you want to do in your MUA) a comment in which you&#8217;ve been tagged.

&gt;<i> Direct mails would be much better.
</I>
No they would not &#8211; getting people on the conversation thread of a PR is vastly superior; it groups the information and discussion in the place where it&#8217;s merged and archives it there. I have certainly had to bisect opam-repository before, so being able to go from a SHA1-&gt;Merge-&gt;PR-&gt;Conversation is very useful.

On this string of PRs, I&#8217;m wondering if you&#8217;re treating the symptom, and not the cause. Each PR so far is to do with an altered checksum from a code service&#8217;s binary release system which suggests that they&#8217;re not canonical (i.e. that they&#8217;ve changed the zip in what should be a trivial manner &#8211; e.g. putting the files in a different order). Rather than fixing the checksums, and causing this to happen again at the whim of a zip library, would it not be better to put in place a policy that zip links should not be to GitHub/BitBucket/Whatever auto-generating URLs but to actual static files (e.g. on github.io)?

Subject: [opam-devel] mailing liste for opam-repo maintainers

Hi,

  Is there a mailing-list for opam-repo maintainers only ? For me, this list is about the development of OPAM itself, I am a bit concerned about the trafic if we start to send emails on this list for synchronisation between repo maintainers. Would it be worth creating <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">opam-repo at ocaml.org</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">opam-repo at ocaml.org</A>&gt; ?

Regards,
--Fabrice
