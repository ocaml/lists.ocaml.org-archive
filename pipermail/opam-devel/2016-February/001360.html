<PRE>Dear Jeremy,

On Mon, Feb 22, 2016 at 11:39 AM Jeremy Yallop &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">yallop at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Is it fair to say that your concerns are primarily about notification

</I>

No, it is about permission. When I publish something on the OPAM
repository, I take some responsability for it. I don't want anybody else to
mess with my packages, and then discover problems that either I could have
discovered much earlier if I had been contacted immediately, or either
caused by a maintainer that didn't know how to fix a problem I had caused.
Am I the only one to care about that ?


&gt;<i>   The problem isn't that people are modifying
</I>&gt;<i> other people's packages, but that the original maintainers aren't
</I>&gt;<i> always notified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I replied to Thomas, would you like Github to modify the source code of
your application they are hosting, and just add an issue in your BTS to
tell you afterwards ?


&gt;<i> One thing I try to do when submitting pull requests that modify
</I>&gt;<i> others' packages is to mention the GitHub username of the maintainer
</I>&gt;<i> in the PR description so that they receive a notification.
</I>

Well, as I am watching tens of repos on Github, my mailbox is full of such
emails. I would not notice such a mention, unless I decide to read the
thread because the title is interesting. Direct mails would be much better.


&gt;<i> If the change is likely to be at all controversial then I wait for the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer to comment before merging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's should be the only way to modify a package. Or if the package
maintainer does not reply to direct emails after a week or two (in which
case either the package should be removed, or the maintainer could be
changed).


&gt;<i> This approach could be mostly automated, with a bot that retrieves the
</I>&gt;<i> username of the original committer of each file from the GitHub API.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I wonder if it'd be sufficient to add a note to the PR check
</I>&gt;<i> procedure (<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/wiki/PR-checks">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/wiki/PR-checks</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that opam-repository maintainers notify package maintainers
</I>&gt;<i> when submitting changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, I think it is not about suggesting, as it is already the case today.
