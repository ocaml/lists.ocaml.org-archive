I think opam2debian might be useful for this, but such packages won't be/aren't meant to be
accepted in upstream distributions.


&gt;<i> Out of interest, do you also need Ubuntu PPA (or the Fedora

</I>&gt;<i> I suspect there will be lots of versioning issues.
</I>
*Iff* Debian also had a PPA yes, otherwise its just easier to point people to just one 
place (either the OpenSUSE build service like you do for opam, or repositories hosted on your own domain).

I use the latter for my company, the tools to build repos (reprepro, createrepo) are fairly easy to use,
it is just that whole cycle of building packages / repositories / QA takes a full day's of work to reach
the desired result for just the 4 packages we have, and I can't see how that could scale up to the hundreds that OPAM has.
For that somehow the whole build process should be more incremental and more parallelizable, i.e. more like a Makefile, but I'm not sure
how well the current tools would support such a workflow. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the `findlib` file in OPAM was a first step to close the gap
</I>&gt;<i> between OASIS and OPAM, and we can continue to add automated scripts
</I>&gt;<i> to keep this information in sync.  It would be good to only depend on
</I>&gt;<i> one package database for this translation, and OPAM is the outermost
</I>&gt;<i> layer and so most appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, I think the last thing is key, since the OPAM version numbers
</I>&gt;<i> also don't map perfectly onto the upstream packaging ones.  For
</I>&gt;<i> Debian or Ubuntu, we'd need to bump the extra versions for any small
</I>&gt;<i> change to the package, whereas OPAM doesn't track these small
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree with this all, and that it's the next important stage to
</I>&gt;<i> make it easier to distribute OCaml applications upstream.  It's quite
</I>&gt;<i> a bit of work, so perhaps we should transfer this design to the OPAM
</I>&gt;<i> wiki to make tracking it easier.
</I>
Wiki page posted here: <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/opam2%7Brpm,deb%7D">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/opam2%7Brpm,deb%7D</A>

I'm known for overcomplicating/overengineering designs, so take this with a grain of salt and consider it more a wishlist
than a definite plan.

I think the short version is:
 * there is no canonical source of metadata, we should have tools to compare the existing sources though (opam, _oasis, debian/control and .spec) to let package maintainer
decide the correct metadata / to let upstream sync the metadata
 * we should have tools that track package (and it dependencies') lifecycle in various major distributions from review -&gt; actual release to avoid dupplication of effort
or see where help is needed (e.g. such a tool would say that in fedora: opam -&gt; ocaml-re APPROVED -&gt; FE-NEEDSPONSOR jonludlam, or aspcud -&gt; gringo -&gt; clasp REVIEW PENDING)

&gt;<i>  Once there is some stability, we can start ticking off various bits of low hanging fruit like the lifecycle query tools, and figure out who can work on what component.
</I>
Yes I think small tools with less ambitious goals would be a good start. I'm mostly interesting in version constraints and C dependencies, so I put some ideas concerning that on the wiki too.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm personally keen on seeing this so that we can have binary
</I>&gt;<i> distributions of Core/Async more easily, as well as distribute the
</I>&gt;<i> MirageOS command-line more sensibly on Ubuntu and Fedora.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
