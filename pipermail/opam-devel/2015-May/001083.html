I'll see what I can do to fix discover.ml better, but given that I know
almost no OCaml it might take a while.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I tried to hack around the problem by using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;--enable-android-target, that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This is expected; the rumprun toolchain does not support dynamic

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and I have configured the ocaml-rumprun compiler with

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there some way to tell OASIS to not expect any shared libraries to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;built?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. OASIS is painfully inflexible, especially when cross-compiling.
</I>&gt;<i> You can probably patch setup.ml so that it thinks that the current
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml is built without dynlink, but this is package-specific.
</I>
Turns out it's a two-line patch, at least in the case of Lwt:

<A HREF="https://github.com/mato/opam-rumprun/commit/3d3a9f0b46a21370c7b619e14cbfddec90acf433">https://github.com/mato/opam-rumprun/commit/3d3a9f0b46a21370c7b619e14cbfddec90acf433</A>

&gt;<i> &gt;AFAICS there are multiple approaches being used in the wild and OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;upstream *claims* to include support for cross-compiling via -host and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;-target, however that support is not actually functional?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cross-compiling is not there yet. The switches are only half functional,
</I>&gt;<i> if you're lucky.
</I>
Yeah, I figured that out after battling with it for a day or so, then found
your patches which mostly[*] worked.

[*: It seems that the Github mirror at ocaml/ocaml is a bit slow, I was
going to write about how I couldn't get your 4.02.02 compiler package to
work without patches, but it looks like the commit for PR#6266 has landed
on Github now, couldn't see it yesterday.]

&gt;<i> &gt;For the rumprun support to be as user-friendly as possible, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;need an easy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;way of switching the backend rumprun cross-compiler and linker used by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ocaml when the user wants to switch platforms or architectures. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;approach used by the android repository I based my work off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implies either:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a) the user would have to *reinstall* the cross compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(specifying eg.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;RUMPRUN_CC in the environment) and all packages using native code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;whenever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;they want to switch the backend compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct. This is what opam-android uses.
</I>
And, as I just found out now, it's not just the native packages, it's *all*
packages that need to be rebuilt. So, for Mirage I'd have to produce
-rumprun variants of all its dependent packages, right? This would include
teaching the &quot;mirage configure&quot; script about them.

This begs the question, why did you use the approach of building the
cross-compiler as a normal OPAM package, rather than as a compiler package?

If I understand correctly how &quot;OPAM switch&quot; works, then the latter option
would at least get rid of the need to deal with the -android (or -rumprun)
renaming of packages since each compiler has its own set of packages.

Obviously, there'd still have to be some way of getting
the OCAMLFIND_TOOLCHAIN and/or other cross-compilation patches into the
system but at first glance it seems like it would be more flexible than
adding suffixes to package names.

Thoughts?
