&gt;<i> So the summary of all this is that you should be using OPAM 1.1, and only with opam.ocaml.org.  OPAM 1.0 is now deprecated.  I don't think we've done a particularly good job of communicating this on the OPAM website though, so I'd quite like to clarify that.  In particular, if someone was using opam.ocamlpro.com via a non-HTTP remote (e.g. git), then the repo redirect will not kick in.
</I>
don't think it's anything to do with non-http remotes. ok-- just to be clear then:

+ we're only interested in opam.1.1.0 *not* in opam.1.0.0

+ the correct default opam repo to use is <A HREF="http://opam.ocaml.org">http://opam.ocaml.org</A>

?

in which case i'm fine, things build under those conditions. but i'll strip out the needless tests from the .travis.yml in at least a few repos; and could you update your ppa sometime so that the default opam remote is opam.ocaml.org rather than opam.ocamlpro.org please?

&gt;<i> Which packages are you blocked on atm?  Sylvain just fixed forge.ocamlcore.org, which also went down last night and broke some packages.
</I>
patches to ocaml-cow to support omd (requires omd &gt;= 0.8 or so), required by patches to cowabloga and (soon perhaps) mirage-www (and right now, my new website though noone else need care about that :)
