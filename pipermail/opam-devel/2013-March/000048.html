Yeah they would.  I was thinking of a heuristic that would require only the root packages to be upgraded to their latest versions (that is, the ones explicitly installed by the OPAM user), and leave intermediate packages until a full upgrade is requested.

However, it would just be easier if the versioning was decoupled from the get-go.
