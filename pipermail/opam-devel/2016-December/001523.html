<PRE>Hi opam-devel,

A few weeks ago I discussed with Jeremy Yallop the idea of having switches
for major OCaml versions (4.01, 4.02, 4.03...) that would point to the
currently-best minor version of them (do you remember? 4.01.0, 4.02.3,
4.03.1).

I would be willing to invest the effort of doing that and maintaining this
mapping, but I feel that just creating new switches is too heavy-handed to
be useful. If I already have a 4.02.3 switch, I would like &quot;opam switch
4.02&quot; to bring me to that switch, not install a new, distinct one with name
4.02 that would in fact install the same compiler as 4.02.3.

Do I correctly understand that this feature is not possible in OPAM 1.2.x?
(If it is, I may do it.)
Is it possible in 2.x?

(Louis: I do distinctly remember your call to try out 2.x at ICFP and I
feel guilty about not having done much yet. Apologies.)
