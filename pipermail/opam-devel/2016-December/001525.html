<PRE>Oh, I'm not trying to get the system to automatically determine what the
best (last) version is, I am fine with doing it by hand. (And it is
probably wiser, if we were to release, say, 4.04.1~beta tomorrow.)

The rest of your description sounds like what I expected indeed, and I
hadn't thought deeply about the upgrade situation but it sounds very nice.

Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi opam-devel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few weeks ago I discussed with Jeremy Yallop the idea of having switches
</I>&gt;<i> for major OCaml versions (4.01, 4.02, 4.03...) that would point to the
</I>&gt;<i> currently-best minor version of them (do you remember? 4.01.0, 4.02.3,
</I>&gt;<i> 4.03.1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be willing to invest the effort of doing that and maintaining this
</I>&gt;<i> mapping, but I feel that just creating new switches is too heavy-handed to
</I>&gt;<i> be useful. If I already have a 4.02.3 switch, I would like &quot;opam switch
</I>&gt;<i> 4.02&quot; to bring me to that switch, not install a new, distinct one with name
</I>&gt;<i> 4.02 that would in fact install the same compiler as 4.02.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do I correctly understand that this feature is not possible in OPAM 1.2.x?
</I>&gt;<i> (If it is, I may do it.)
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible in 2.x?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Louis: I do distinctly remember your call to try out 2.x at ICFP and I
</I>&gt;<i> feel guilty about not having done much yet. Apologies.)
</I>&gt;<i>
