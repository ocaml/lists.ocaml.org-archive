<PRE>In opam 2.0, it should definitely be possible to do it with a kind of dummy package which has a version constraint on the underlying OCaml package holding the appropriate ocaml package below the next version (e.g. &lt; 4.03.0 for the 4.02 channel &#8211; there might be a cleverer constraint than that even, IIRC). Each major version would correspond to a version of the package (say ocaml-branch.4.02 or something) which you&#8217;d then pin at that version. A neat side-effect is that if a new maintenance release were made, the switch would be upgradable. It would also not require maintenance, beyond adding new major release versions.

It&#8217;s not aliases, but would it do what you&#8217;re after? All of that&#8217;s impossible in OPAM 1.x &#8211; the best bet there would be to have an opam-admin script which can process the compilers directory and re-generate the branch packages (something similar to Anil&#8217;s script for the GPRs).

PS My strange patching work means I do keenly remember all point releases since 3.07 &#8211; who released 4.03.1 without telling me ;o)

Subject: [opam-devel] Multiple names for the same switch (aliases that are really aliases)

Hi opam-devel,
A few weeks ago I discussed with Jeremy Yallop the idea of having switches for major OCaml versions (4.01, 4.02, 4.03...) that would point to the currently-best minor version of them (do you remember? 4.01.0, 4.02.3, 4.03.1).
I would be willing to invest the effort of doing that and maintaining this mapping, but I feel that just creating new switches is too heavy-handed to be useful. If I already have a 4.02.3 switch, I would like &quot;opam switch 4.02&quot; to bring me to that switch, not install a new, distinct one with name 4.02 that would in fact install the same compiler as 4.02.3.
Do I correctly understand that this feature is not possible in OPAM 1.2.x? (If it is, I may do it.)
Is it possible in 2.x?
(Louis: I do distinctly remember your call to try out 2.x at ICFP and I feel guilty about not having done much yet. Apologies.)
