</I>&gt;&gt;<i> None of these seem like substantive blockers. A quick online hunt shows that they're planning to extend the API to add Releases when it's stable. An API would let us easily automate including the CHANGES file in the release tag, as well as auto-generating the release tarballs with the autogen files. For now, I've experimentally released ocaml-cow to see what it looks like:

</I>&gt;<i> Sure but at that point you actually implemented the damn thing by yourself, which does indicates that they released a toy&#8230;
</I>
To reiterate: it now has the facility for binary downloads, which they yanked about 12 months ago due to scaling issues.  You couldn't do that before, and you can do so now (albeit manually).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact I realize now that opam's .install files do actually work as advertised. I don't think external tools or the github Release API are needed here (and we want to be able to consult that while being disconnected).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With install files it's easy to add README{,.md} and CHANGES{,.md} to the doc directory of the package located in .opam/$SWITCH/doc/$PKG
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it would just be a matter of looking up if these files exist in that directory and spit them out, or simply provide some kind of standard invocation to enable easy access to documentation directory of a package.
</I>
Yep, I agree with this.  Do you write your META files by hand at the moment?
