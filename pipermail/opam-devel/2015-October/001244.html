<PRE>The proposal looks fine to me.

One thing what I'd like is the system to stay simple when people don't use cross-compilation. That might mean maybe renaming `build-os` to `os` so that things stays as they are when build-os = host-os = os. Could also mean that `build-prefix` is a special case and don't contains the `&lt;arch&gt;` suffix. 

About the automatic installation of packages when adding a new architecture to the switch: I'm not very found of that. I usually misspell my `git remote add` commands and I'm happy to have `git remote set-url` and `git fetch` as separate commands. So maybe in this case, just lazily install the missing packages for the new arch on `opam upgrade` and `opam install`. So I think that the constraint: &quot;all installed packages should have the same version for all the architectures&quot; is fine, but the constraint &quot;all installed packages should be installed on all architectures&quot; is too strong. So maybe you want `opam install --arch`.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started to write down a few ideas for supporting multiple architecture (i.e. cross-compilation) in opam. It's far from complete, glosses over many details and maybe too simplistic &#8212; but I have the feeling that it's better to try to keep things simple in that setting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will certainly not be the person who can fill in all the details &#8212; especially on how to solve and resolve dependencies, I'm sure the solver experts have a better idea of what is needed here than what I'm proposing. People who are familiar with `apt` multi-architecture support may also be in a better position to design this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I just dumped my broken set of ideas on the opam wiki so that people can help to improve it and bring it to a full proposal:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback and discussion about the general approach is better done on this list I think. And this should start with whether the support should be handled as an inter or intra switch feature; this proposal being the latter (for these reasons [1]). I know there were attempts at the former so it would be nice if we could reach consensus on this first.
