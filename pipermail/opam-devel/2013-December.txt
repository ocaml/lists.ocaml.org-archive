Subject: [opam-devel] redirect in 1.1 opam-repository should be removd?
Message-ID: <26E9B6DA-F023-4B6C-9CC6-DC7054708818@recoil.org>

Should the repo file in the ocaml/opam-repository contain the `redirect` field?  That strikes me as something that should only be in the 1.0 repo.  Right now if someone mirrors the 1.1 repository via http, it'll redirect off to opam.ocaml.org again.

[CCing opam-devel]

OPAM 1.1 changed the repository format sufficiently that an OPAM 1.0 client can no longer read a 1.1-format repository.

Therefore, the transition to OPAM 1.1 also involved setting up a new 1.1-only repository, which we put at https://opam.ocaml.org.

In order to migrate people from the old repo to the new one, we also added a 'repo' file that can issue a redirect when a 1.1 client connects to the old 1.0 repositories.

So the summary of all this is that you should be using OPAM 1.1, and only with opam.ocaml.org.  OPAM 1.0 is now deprecated.  I don't think we've done a particularly good job of communicating this on the OPAM website though, so I'd quite like to clarify that.  In particular, if someone was using opam.ocamlpro.com via a non-HTTP remote (e.g. git), then the repo redirect will not kick in.

Which packages are you blocked on atm?  Sylvain just fixed forge.ocamlcore.org, which also went down last night and broke some packages.

cheers,
Anil

That's correct (to clarify, https://opam.ocaml.org works too, not just the http:// URL).

OPAM 1.1 is in both Debian unstable and Homebrew now, so there's no point supporting the older version.

I'm confused -- which PPA has opam.ocamlpro.com hardcoded in?  They should all be on OPAM 1.1 now.

patches to ocaml-cow to support omd (requires omd >= 0.8 or so), required by patches to cowabloga and (soon perhaps) mirage-www (and right now, my new website though noone else need care about that :)

Right, it's not needed at all (actually was an obsolete PR to the master branch that was merged after the repo switch). Removing it.

This is not a problem with OPAM since it supports package constraints.

However, it would be *very* helpful if multiple versions of OASIS could
be installed at the same time in this case.  Right now, if two packages
depend on OASIS with mutually incompatible versions, that will result in
an installation failure.

Until then, I'd prefer to keep the dependency chain for Core as
short as possible (i.e. just commit the autogenerated files as things are
right now).

While I was developing the tests for tsdl, ocp-index was giving me completion on the library; I guess it automatically hunts for annot files in _build. I'm now using the library through opam but the completion is missing and that makes me very sad (absolutely).

What are the guidelines for opam/ocp-index integration. Should packages install .annot files ? 

Thanks,

If you install the cmt files of your library this should just work (I think ocp-index looks for any _build or _obuild parent subdir to find the cmt of the current project and in all `opam config var lib` subdirs for the installed packages).

All of the cmt[i] ? Or are cmti of the published interfaces enough ?

hum, I think cmi (and optionally cmti) should be enough if you just want autocompletion.

Ok so if I gather well:

1) Installing a .cmi is enough for completion and getting the type. 
2) Installing .cmti adds the (ocaml)docs of each function (which is nice).

However:
> (I think ocp-index looks for any _build or _obuild parent subdir to find the cmt of the current project and in all `opam config var lib` subdirs for the installed packages).
This assertion seems to be wrong:

> ocp-index complete Tsdl.Sdl.init



returns nothing. While:

> ocp-index complete -I `opam config var tsdl:lib` Tsdl.Sdl.init
Tsdl.Sdl.init val Init.t -> unit result

Tsdl.Sdl.init_sub_system val Init.t -> unit result

Should I file a bug report with ocp-index ? 

Best,

Daniel

Hi all,

I've tried to simplify the use of Leo's opam-doc and I came up with a pretty simple workflow.

1. install opam-doc: 

git clone git at github.com:samoht/opam-doc.git
cd opam-doc
opam install cow && make && make install

This will create a `doc` switch with the right compiler wrappers, and it will install opam-doc-* scripts in your current switch.

2. build the documentation

opam doc PKG1 ... PKGn

this will install the various packages in the `doc` switch, call the various scripts to install the cmd files at the right place and generate the HTML pages and so on. Finally, it will serve the contents of ~/.opam/doc/doc on http://127.0.0.1:8000 than you can then browse locally (using python -m SimpleHTTPServer).

This is still a very preliminary work (I'd love to replace the bunch of scripts by a proper OCaml program -- to easily change host port/name for instance) but I'd gladly welcome your feedback.

Best,
Thomas

I've just merged an opam-doc package into ocaml/opam-repository. Should land in your 'opam update' pretty soon.

So the new instructions:
1. opam install opam-doc
2. opam doc  PKG1 ... PKGn
3. open your browser to point to http://127.0.0.1:8000

The goal of that early release is to gather feedback, so please use and shout at https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/issues

NB: the package is only available for system compilers (and alias of system compilers) with version 4.01.0.

Best,
Thomas

Yup. Additionally, the .cmt may be used if the cmti is absent, when specified on the command-line (done on the currently open file by emacs), or when looking up the implementation location.

I've created (extremely) experimental PPAs for the 4.02.0dev series, with the intention of using them to run bulk builds on OPAM to find users of camlp4 and labltk that need explicitly marked packages.

I won't have time to integrate these into anything for a while, but if anyone else wants to help with the 4.02 triage of issues, let me know.

Subject: [opam-devel] OPAM+Vagrant, and calling Emacs gurus
Message-ID: <5EE60EA5-98E0-4D7F-87B9-46DFB9F5B9E8@recoil.org>

I'm putting together a Vagrant VM for the 'opam in a box' effort:
https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/1035

Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/) is a virtual machine manager that
makes it easy to spin up development instances on MacOS X and Windows
(unlike Docker, which is Linux only at present).

I've got a Vagrant repo here:
https://github.com/avsm/vagrant-opam

...which installs opam-doc, Core, Async and Merlin, and a preconfigured
Vim configuration.  Unfortunately, I know nothing about Emacs. Would
anyone be willing to commit a setup-emacs.sh script that's similar to
the setup-vim.sh one, along with brief instructions on how to use it?

To use it, just install Vagrant and VirtualBox, and:

$ git clone git://github.com/avsm/vagrant-opam
$ cd vagrant-opam
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh 

And you'll be SSHed into the VM.

There are already a number of Emacs instructions here on the Real
World OCaml site, and it would be nice to match those (including the
utop integration) so that students have a nice experience.

http://realworldocaml.org/install

Once that's set up, I'll configure one of our infrastructure machines
to rebuild the Vagrant box regularly and publish it live, so that it
can cloned quickly by anyone without having to build all the packages.


thanks!
Anil

I've started to fill-up https://github.com/samoht/ocaml-emacs-settings with my own emacs settings, I'm just preparing a PR to your repo with the basic emacs configuration in.
