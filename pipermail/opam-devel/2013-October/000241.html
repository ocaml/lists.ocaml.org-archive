<PRE>Hi,

&lt;as usual, shameless plug&gt;Most of my libraries use _oasis and I use
oasis2debian to create and distribute Debian packages which really
look like what you get from standard Debian distribution (I am a
former Debian Developer). I think it is a great idea but it has some
shortcomings, including the need to rebuild everything if a deps in
the chain change... but we can discuss this elsewhere.&lt;/as usual,
shameless plug&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> Some of my colleagues think that distributing ocaml dependencies in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfy them, with a solution that somehow exports as binary snapshot

</I>&gt;<i> [Ccing opam-devel and also Citrix/Rackspace folk, as this came up

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In fact, I also need a tool like this. I was planning to create an
opam2debian that given a set of packages build a big .deb containing
the compiled OCaml code. I am extremly interested to see if something
exists or to participate in coding it (well I'll do it at one point
but won't complain if someone else does it).

But rather than targeting ~/.opam/4.01 it should be installed in
/opt/opam/4.01, I think there is an OPAMROOT variable somewhere. This
way you can get stable filename in your target (because &quot;~&quot; will
expand differently and some OCaml packages use hardcoded path).

Another interesting challenge is to &quot;fake&quot; the filesystem to make OPAM
and the underlying build system install in
$CURDIR/debian/tmp/opt/opam/4.01, while it thinks it install in
/opt/opam/4.01 (system call diversion may work for most installer).
And also fake ACL for that (but we have fakeroot in this case).

Concerning just taring the .opam, you will have anyway problem with
&quot;~&quot; path expansion + missing deps...

If someone want this program, count me in.

&gt;<i> This has also been a frequent request for teaching purposes, so I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to experiment with version controlling .opam -- this would just
</I>&gt;<i> require hooks when adding/creating files in the subdirectory hierarchy,
</I>&gt;<i> although it would probably be too slow to shell out every time
</I>&gt;<i> (Thomas' cagit OCaml library may come in useful here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dave/Jon/John, any thoughts on this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Cheers
Sylvain
