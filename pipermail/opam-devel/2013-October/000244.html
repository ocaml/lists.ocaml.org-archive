You don't need the list of files for a Debian package.... You don't
even need the dependencies, since it is auto-computed (except for
depending on executable, but this is a minor annoyance, lib deps are
computed).

Maybe you are talking about directly generating a binary .deb ? (like
directly an ar archive, but that is super tricky to do)

&gt;<i> One slightly odd thing about tarring up the .opam directory is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> usually something that lives in a user's home directory. I wonder if any
</I>&gt;<i> of the packages might have hard-coded paths in there which would mean
</I>&gt;<i> having to install it into exactly the same place - so requiring the same
</I>&gt;<i> user. I guess a quick grep through the .opam dir would tell you this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Packages use hard coded paths. Most of the things that loads data in
fact (just an example: camomile). When the software has already gone
through a Debian packaging process, you should have a reliable
DESTDIR, but that is not 100% sure.
