Yeah, that makes sense.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The issue with `make lib-ext` may be that `opam-admin.top` can't find the 
</I>&gt;<i> proper opam libraries installed. The Makefile in `admin-scripts/` has a quick 
</I>&gt;<i> hack to build bytecode versions, but that reiles on `ocamlfind` to locate the 
</I>&gt;<i> installed versions of the dependencies; it wouldn't be difficult to improve it 
</I>&gt;<i> to work with `lib-ext` though.
</I>
It would be very useful if they could work with lib-ext and the toplevel be built by default.  Right now there is some oddness where the extlib interactive installer is run if I build `opam-admin.top` manually, so I gave up around there.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, for scripts that get generally useful and somewhat stable, it's perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> fine to migrate them to be part of opam-admin. Moving the scripts to their own 
</I>&gt;<i> repo would also be fine if they reach a critical weight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should we improve compat of the Makefile and/or move the 1.2-&gt;2.0 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality to opam-admin ?
</I>
For the purposes of container-based testing, it would be great if we could move the essential functionality into `opam admin` directly.  This will let me insert in the right `git clone / opam admin upgrade` runs into the CI scripts so that OPAM 2 is easy to test for end users.
