Dear all,

I'm resurrecting this thread to get some information about the current
status of CUDF solver packaging on Fedora.

I am myself a happy user of the COPR ascpud packages, but for new
Fedora users it would be nice to have something packaged in the main
repository. Is that a possibility?

In the longer term, the packages will get into Fedora and everything will be fine, but don't forget that in the medium term that the Yum remotes will remain on people's computers for some time, and there's significant confusion in mixing up OBS and Copr packages.

The reason is that mine are better tested, but they also use the bundled OCaml packages, whereas Jon's are upstream-friendly and break out the OPAM dependencies.  There have been bugs from doing this in the past (e.g. with a libdose3 mismatch), so it's best to let this settle down upstream before pointing a large user base at a Copr remote that may still be a moving target.
