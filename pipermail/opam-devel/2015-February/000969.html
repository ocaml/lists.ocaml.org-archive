This needs some experimentation, but it would not be as naive as simply
shelling out to Git, as we have a complete implementation in pure OCaml.
It would also be optional, and history rebased regularly so as not to
grow too far (just as `git gc` does).  Binary compression can also be
sorted out asynchronously.

Adding this feature has a number of upsides in the future, particularly
for sharing OPAM installations in classroom environments, which has been
a very common request.

I'm almost certain it could be implemented outside of OPAM by adding
the right build-time hooks, which may be shareable with the sandboxing
infrastructure.  This discussion for a plugin API has come up several
times, and this the right time to add it now that we have several concrete
usecases (depext, sandbox, vcs)
