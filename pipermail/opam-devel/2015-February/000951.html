This is really *not easy* in the current state of affairs

 -&gt; opam calls whatever command is declared in the build:/install: fields

 -&gt; this command can do whatever it wants; a sloppy Makefile might very well end
    up removing all the user-writeable files on a machine; think of something like

    PREFIX=$(HOME)/$(MYNICELOCALVAR)   # ooops ... using a var defined only on the dev machine!

    install:
        rm -rf $(PREFIX) # clean up dest dir on the dev machine; rm -rf $(HOME) everywhere else!
        ....

 -&gt; it's easy to pass through the integration test on opam-repository too: if
    somebody really wants to make bad jokes, one can simply check the
    environment to be nice when going through Travis, and wreak havoc elsewhere

In the GNU/Linux distribution world, we face a similar challenge, with install
scripts being on top run as root; the very stringent QA process enforced
by these communities mitigates the problem quite a bit, of course, but
it is still there and s*it happens.

That's why I was asking for the characteristics of the sandboxing techniques we
known. As with security, &quot;sandbox&quot; is a term easy to use, but difficult to
achieve.

My best bet is _really_ the ptrace approach followed by Mcqueen in
<A HREF="http://robot101.net/files/trace.tar.gz">http://robot101.net/files/trace.tar.gz</A> as it allows to monitor _all_ file
access even by statically linked binaries, and is able to make a backup
copy of modified files (to restore them, if something goes wrong).

What I do not know is whether something similar is available for *BSD,
and even less for Windows.

And of course, this would make yet another external dependency, but there
is no free lunch.

Cheers
