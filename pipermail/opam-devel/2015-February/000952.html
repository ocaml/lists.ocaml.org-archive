<PRE>Yes, that's the kind of thing I had in mind. Incidentally, the Makefile joke happened to me while in school, a few days before a project was due -- never forgot the lesson :) (I removed the unused DOC variable definition. Except `make clean` had `rm -rf $(DOC)/`. Notice the last char...)

This is more related to protecting against mistakes than protecting against malice, like repo signing is, but both are important. The point being that _if_ a malicious package makes it through, it can just do the bad stuff at runtime once it's installed rather than do it during compilation or installation. And that's actually easier to hide from the repo maintainers. Therefore, not having a completely secure sandboxing solution is not a blocker if one isn't easily available.

&gt;<i> My best bet is _really_ the ptrace approach followed by Mcqueen in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://robot101.net/files/trace.tar.gz">http://robot101.net/files/trace.tar.gz</A> as it allows to monitor _all_ file
</I>&gt;<i> access even by statically linked binaries, and is able to make a backup
</I>&gt;<i> copy of modified files (to restore them, if something goes wrong).
</I>
Sounds cool, I'll check that out. I am also aware of <A HREF="http://proot.me/">http://proot.me/</A>
