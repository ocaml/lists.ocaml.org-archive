Subject: [opam-devel] opam repository signing
Message-ID: <87bc18bc-8714-feb9-d4ff-8fa2f89fed8e@mehnert.org>

I finally released conex [1], to be used for signing package release,
and verification of repositories.  Earlier I analysed all PRs to the
opam repository within the last 4.5 years and found actual maintainers
of packages [2].

A getting started guide is available at
https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/Conex - we need to decide on team members
(all teams are empty right now), especially janitors.

Feedback is appreciated, as usual,

hannes
