Also, our release tarballs always include a `opam-full-xxx.tar.gz` which includes all needed source trees and can be made without further downloads (you just need a working OCaml -- and now, C++ too -- compiler installed).

Subject: [opam-devel] GitHub PR compiler switches now have their own remote
Message-ID: <45410078-83E5-4216-88E5-7ACBE02E6E7F@recoil.org>

Dear all,

I would like to draw your attention to a rearrangement of the opam-repository to streamline the number of compiler variants that are available by default:
 
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-compiler-prs-are-migrating-to-their-own-remote/905

If you were using the "opam switch 4.06.0+pr944" functionality before, it will continue to work if you add this remote to your development environment:

    opam repo add ocaml-pr https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-pr-repository.git

Removing this from the main opam repository in turn makes it far easier for us with preparations for the upcoming switch to simultaneously support opam1 and opam2-format repositories.  More on that later :)

regards,
Anil

In addition to tags like:
ocaml/opam:alpine_ocaml-4.04.2

There should also be:
ocaml/opam:alpine_ocaml-4.04

So that the user can be sure that the latest 4.04 release is always used.

Of course it'd also be great to have tags for flambda builds.

So in addition to tags like:
ocaml/opam:alpine_ocaml-4.04.2_flambda

There should also be:
ocaml/opam:alpine_ocaml-4.04_flambda

Taking into account all the other possible combinations, we'll also have
e.g.:
ocaml/opam:alpine-3.6_ocaml-4.04
ocaml/opam:alpine-3.6_ocaml-4.04_flambda
