<PRE>Thanks for these comments !

* Rewrite the parallel command engine

This is well underway, I've got a working prototype with limited backends at the moment.
I'm not relying on fork anymore, but we'll still need some windows way of implementing `Unix.waitpid 0`; and to add OS switches to the build system.

* Native system manipulation

I agree on re-coding cp, mv etc.; here is also a possible idea, it may be worth checking if it's practical: make sure we may work if limited to busybox, and include some Windows version of busybox in the Windows distribution.

* Test &amp; fix on Windows
&gt;<i> &quot;Cygwin, then, maybe, native.&quot; I'm afraid implies a crucial misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> of how OCaml-on-Windows works.
</I>
I know that Cygwin is hardly a step towards native windows compatibility and about the cross-compilation tangle. But given the difference in cost, I think it's worth ensuring Cygwin is well supported before attacking the bulk of the problem: you quickly trip over tiny issues even with Cygwin at the moment.

&gt;<i> Related to this, are there general plans at the moment for how OPAM may deal
</I>&gt;<i> with cross-compiling? This becomes relevant with four Windows ports
</I>
There is quite some amount of thought about it, but no plan yet.

@Anil, on the &quot;os&quot; variable, we have &quot;cygwin&quot; and &quot;win32&quot;, following Sys.os_type().


Cheers,
Louis


Le dimanche 2 novembre 2014, 20:48:37 David Allsopp a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> For OCaml 4.02, instead of spending the time I would normally use on a
</I>&gt;<i> compiler upgrade bringing my private build scripts up-to-date, I've been
</I>&gt;<i> doing some work porting OPAM to Windows. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm chipping away at this - mainly at 'weekends'! - and will publish to
</I>&gt;<i> dra27/opam on GitHub hopefully within the next fortnight (if someone else is
</I>&gt;<i> also actively working on a Windows port and would like to see the stuff
</I>&gt;<i> sooner, then ping me a message - there're just too many hacks on the TODO
</I>&gt;<i> list to bother with pushing commits at the moment). So far I've got opam
</I>&gt;<i> init working (including installing the base packages) though I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> polishing some of the scripts for opam config env. Next up is being able to
</I>&gt;<i> switch to another compiler instance and install some packages, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> feeling that the bulk of the hard work is already done now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All that said, the main purpose of this message is to offer some comment on
</I>&gt;<i> the portability section of the 1.3 Roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/1.3-Roadmap">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/1.3-Roadmap</A>) which I hope will be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Rewrite the parallel command engine
</I>&gt;<i> This is a 'de facto' requirement for porting to Windows, because it's used
</I>&gt;<i> to install the base packages and removing it was easy. My own code only
</I>&gt;<i> avoids Unix.fork (and Unix.wait) for Windows, but it would be beneficial for
</I>&gt;<i> both Unix and Windows to use the same code path, obviously. I simply
</I>&gt;<i> converted everything to Marshal - the child closure is sent on stdin to
</I>&gt;<i> additional opam processes (using a special --fork command line switch). It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be working, though some subtleties with global variables might rear
</I>&gt;<i> their heads when I start installing packages and trying to push the --jobs
</I>&gt;<i> switch later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Native system manipulation
</I>&gt;<i> While I think invocations of wget/curl could beneficially be replaced with
</I>&gt;<i> ocamlnet and tar with ocaml-tar, I think replacing all other calls (rm, cp,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) this is a bad idea or, at least it should certainly not be done on the
</I>&gt;<i> false altar of making Windows-use better/easier. OPAM is a source-based
</I>&gt;<i> package manager - OCaml itself requires a bash-like environment to compile
</I>&gt;<i> (for *all* Windows ports, including the Microsoft-based ones) and let's not
</I>&gt;<i> forget that a possible bash-free alternative for building OCaml was
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently removed from the source tree. And that's before looking at
</I>&gt;<i> packages - it's na&#239;ve to imagine, given the majority of package authors
</I>&gt;<i> being Unix-based in one flavour or another, that there will ever a point
</I>&gt;<i> where anything approaching a majority of package build systems are totally
</I>&gt;<i> shell-agnostic. It seems to me to be much better to head towards a system
</I>&gt;<i> which can expect various standard Unix commands to be available (via Cygwin,
</I>&gt;<i> MSYS, GnuWin32, etc.) but aim not to require the actual shell to be Unix
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. work within Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.). In this model, the aim
</I>&gt;<i> is to make Windows sufficiently Unix-like so that supporting Windows becomes
</I>&gt;<i> a matter of small configure-style tweaks already required to support various
</I>&gt;<i> flavours of Unix anyway. In my experience, packages which end up with two
</I>&gt;<i> build systems (the main one, and something hacked for Windows) end up with a
</I>&gt;<i> very stale, broken Windows build system, because the maintainer quite
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably ends up releasing later versions without testing whether the
</I>&gt;<i> Windows build system still works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Test &amp; fix on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Cygwin, then, maybe, native.&quot; I'm afraid implies a crucial misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> of how OCaml-on-Windows works. I haven't checked, but OPAM should already
</I>&gt;<i> compile for *Cygwin* because Cygwin is simply Unix. The only thing which may
</I>&gt;<i> be broken is the odd configure check (i.e. correctly parsing the output of
</I>&gt;<i> uname). But understand that that means compiling OPAM in *Cygwin*'s OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> (which is OCaml built using ./configure in the normal way, not by using the
</I>&gt;<i> manual files in config/). Having OPAM working for Cygwin is a good idea,
</I>&gt;<i> indeed it'd be a good to have a Cygwin package of OPAM if someone were
</I>&gt;<i> willing to maintain it. But it's a trivial target - virtually nothing should
</I>&gt;<i> require altering, because that's the point of Cygwin. So it's either
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;native&quot; (i.e. the MinGW and MSVC ports) or not really worth talking about!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The four Windows ports are cross-compiled using a Cygwin bash shell as the
</I>&gt;<i> *environment* (note that a lot of this can be done using an MSYS bash shell
</I>&gt;<i> as the environment too). But the compilers are all cross-compilers (although
</I>&gt;<i> because the architecture for both compilation and target is the same, most
</I>&gt;<i> configure scripts do not realise that they are cross compiling!) - which is
</I>&gt;<i> why the build system can use things like &quot;/bin/sh&quot; (which Cygwin C runtime
</I>&gt;<i> translates it) but the resulting OCaml environment cannot (because the
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft Visual C Runtime, unsurprisingly, does not). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, it's easy to interact with Cygwin commands (rm, cp, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> because they're all coded to recognise Windows paths if they're specified
</I>&gt;<i> with forward slashes (C:/Windows\system32 is a perfectly valid Windows path
</I>&gt;<i> and, indeed, for the Command Interpreter, even C:/&quot;W&quot;indows\&quot;&quot;system32 is a
</I>&gt;<i> valid path!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My experience (based on my own installation of around 45 or so OCaml and
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml-related packages) is that building for Windows usually just involves
</I>&gt;<i> overriding some lazy assumptions in build systems (for example, the most
</I>&gt;<i> common one being the assumption &quot;we're building on Windows&quot; =&gt; &quot;object files
</I>&gt;<i> end in .obj&quot;) so nothing which can't be quickly committed upstream, or
</I>&gt;<i> applied in opam-repository patches. I don't expect there will be &quot;generic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> fixes, beyond trying to cp &quot;foo.exe&quot; if &quot;foo&quot; cannot be found in a .install
</I>&gt;<i> file (which I'm coding up anyway in my fork). What may be useful is to have
</I>&gt;<i> certain non-OCaml packages packaged up in OPAM for Windows-only - for
</I>&gt;<i> example, openssl, pcre and so on to deal with libraries which aren't
</I>&gt;<i> normally packaged for Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Related to this, are there general plans at the moment for how OPAM may deal
</I>&gt;<i> with cross-compiling? This becomes relevant with four Windows ports - one of
</I>&gt;<i> the big advantages with opam (and the whole model of opam config env) is
</I>&gt;<i> that it will make it much easier to run all four Windows ports on the same
</I>&gt;<i> machine, but it seems very tedious (and difficult to maintain) to need to
</I>&gt;<i> specify every single compiler switch 5 times (e.g. 4.02.0, 4.02.0+msvc,
</I>&gt;<i> 4.02.0+mingw, 4.02.0+msvc64, 4.02.0+mingw64). I was thinking of adding a
</I>&gt;<i> Windows-only (for now) --target option to opam switch for an enumeration of
</I>&gt;<i> auto/mingw/msvc/mingw64/msvc64. So opam switch 4.02.0+foo --target=mingw64
</I>&gt;<i> would build the 64-bit MinGW port of OCaml in ~/.opam/4.02.0+foo+mingw64. It
</I>&gt;<i> would obviously also be useful for opam files to be able to reference the
</I>&gt;<i> value of --target.
