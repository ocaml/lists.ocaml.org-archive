</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Rewrite the parallel command engine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is well underway, I've got a working prototype with limited backends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not relying on fork anymore, but we'll still need some windows way of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing `Unix.waitpid 0`; and to add OS switches to the build system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although Windows has them, Windows and Unix process groups aren't quite the same concept. I expect you want more the behaviour of Unix.waitpid (-1) (any child) which is sort of what I implemented in my branch. In fact, the way waiting works under Windows, the stub I implemented specifically waits for any one of a list of PIDs to terminate. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Indeed I meant Unix.waitpid (-1), I don't use groups. And I've got the list of pids to wait for already, so your solution may actually be a better fit.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Native system manipulation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree on re-coding cp, mv etc.; here is also a possible idea, it may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worth checking if it's practical: make sure we may work if limited to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; busybox, and include some Windows version of busybox in the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But unless you guarantee that all 700/800 packages in OPAM do the same thing, at some point you will need a &quot;real&quot; environment - make, patch, m4, etc (you can't even get as far as findlib without m4) and ocamlopt's need for a C compiler, or at least an assembler, is never far away - and the two MSVC ports will *always* require you to install the Windows SDK separately to get the Microsoft assembler (I don't think packaging that in other setups is permitted under the licence).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree that making OPAM more portable is a good idea (ocaml-fileutils would be a very good thing to use), but my point is that it has *nothing* to do with making Windows usage of OPAM better, at least for non-toy usage so, at least for this part of the roadmap, it feels like effort targeted at the wrong problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You have a point ; this also depends on whether we have interest in a working OPAM on Windows _independently_ of the current OCaml OPAM repo or not. But let's be clear and mention this as the goal if we target a more portable OPAM depending as little as possible on POSIX tools.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Test &amp; fix on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Cygwin, then, maybe, native.&quot; I'm afraid implies a crucial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; misunderstanding of how OCaml-on-Windows works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that Cygwin is hardly a step towards native windows compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and about the cross-compilation tangle. But given the difference in cost,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it's worth ensuring Cygwin is well supported before attacking the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bulk of the problem: you quickly trip over tiny issues even with Cygwin at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What tiny issues have you seen? I've just bootstrapped OPAM on OCaml 4.01.0 on Cygwin 1.7 with no problems, as I expected. I've been able to switch into 4.01.0, run opam install opam-lib --deps-only and re-compile OPAM 1.2 using its &quot;own&quot; compiler. I had trouble with 4.02.1, but that's because there's a bug in ocamlbuild, which is hardly OPAM's fault! I've put a patch at <A HREF="http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/~dra27/patches/ocaml-4.02.1+cygwin.patch">http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/~dra27/patches/ocaml-4.02.1+cygwin.patch</A> and will shortly see if the issue is already mentioned in Mantis and with that patch was able to switch into 4.02.1 and similarly bootstrap OPAM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Bad handling of the separator in the PATH variable, for example, but that has been fixed a while ago. I expected to find more of this kind of stuff, but if there is none, that's very good news!

&gt;<i> Incidentally, the problem with Cygwin and OCaml 4.02.1 is a reasonable demonstration of why stripping out external calls to cp, etc. can be a BAD idea! Cygwin neatly masks the &quot;.exe&quot; problem if you do things POSIX-ly. Consider:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $ test -e /usr/bin/ocaml &amp;&amp; echo OCaml is installed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a Cygwin bash prompt, this will echo that OCaml is indeed installed. Now, in reality /usr/bin/ocaml is C:\cygwin\bin\ocaml.exe and test -e /usr/bin/ocaml.exe will also be true. ocamlbuild fails because for reasons best understood by Nicolas Pouillard, it replaces Sys.file_exists with a manual attempt to read the directory entries itself (see ocamlbuild/my_std.ml and notes in ocamlbuild/Changelog) - and in so doing bypasses Cygwin's compatibility layers which handle the &quot;.exe&quot; problem for Cygwin.
