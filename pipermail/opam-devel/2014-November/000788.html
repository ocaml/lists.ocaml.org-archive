Le Tue Nov 04 2014 at 8:42:09 AM, Louis Gesbert &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">louis.gesbert at ocamlpro.com</A>&gt;
a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Thanks for these comments !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Rewrite the parallel command engine
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is well underway, I've got a working prototype with limited backends
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not relying on fork anymore, but we'll still need some windows way of
</I>&gt;<i> implementing `Unix.waitpid 0`; and to add OS switches to the build system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>* Native system manipulation
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree on re-coding cp, mv etc.; here is also a possible idea, it may be
</I>&gt;<i> worth checking if it's practical: make sure we may work if limited to
</I>&gt;<i> busybox, and include some Windows version of busybox in the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am about to release a new version of ocaml-fileutils that have
better implementation of cp, mv than the previous version. You may
consider using it. POSIX implementation of those command require some
work.


ocaml-fileutils has also a low number of dependencies that makes it
more suitable for inclusion.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Test &amp; fix on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Cygwin, then, maybe, native.&quot; I'm afraid implies a crucial
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of how OCaml-on-Windows works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that Cygwin is hardly a step towards native windows compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> and about the cross-compilation tangle. But given the difference in cost, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's worth ensuring Cygwin is well supported before attacking the
</I>&gt;<i> bulk of the problem: you quickly trip over tiny issues even with Cygwin at
</I>&gt;<i> the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Related to this, are there general plans at the moment for how OPAM may
</I>&gt;<i> deal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with cross-compiling? This becomes relevant with four Windows ports
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is quite some amount of thought about it, but no plan yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Anil, on the &quot;os&quot; variable, we have &quot;cygwin&quot; and &quot;win32&quot;, following
</I>&gt;<i> Sys.os_type().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Louis

</I>&gt;<i> Le dimanche 2 novembre 2014, 20:48:37 David Allsopp a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For OCaml 4.02, instead of spending the time I would normally use on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiler upgrade bringing my private build scripts up-to-date, I've been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing some work porting OPAM to Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm chipping away at this - mainly at 'weekends'! - and will publish to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dra27/opam on GitHub hopefully within the next fortnight (if someone
</I>&gt;<i> else is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also actively working on a Windows port and would like to see the stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sooner, then ping me a message - there're just too many hacks on the TODO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list to bother with pushing commits at the moment). So far I've got opam
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; init working (including installing the base packages) though I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; polishing some of the scripts for opam config env. Next up is being able
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch to another compiler instance and install some packages, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feeling that the bulk of the hard work is already done now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All that said, the main purpose of this message is to offer some comment
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the portability section of the 1.3 Roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/1.3-Roadmap">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/1.3-Roadmap</A>) which I hope will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Rewrite the parallel command engine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a 'de facto' requirement for porting to Windows, because it's
</I>&gt;<i> used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to install the base packages and removing it was easy. My own code only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avoids Unix.fork (and Unix.wait) for Windows, but it would be beneficial
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both Unix and Windows to use the same code path, obviously. I simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; converted everything to Marshal - the child closure is sent on stdin to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; additional opam processes (using a special --fork command line switch).
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to be working, though some subtleties with global variables might
</I>&gt;<i> rear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their heads when I start installing packages and trying to push the
</I>&gt;<i> --jobs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Native system manipulation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While I think invocations of wget/curl could beneficially be replaced
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ocamlnet and tar with ocaml-tar, I think replacing all other calls (rm,
</I>&gt;<i> cp,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc.) this is a bad idea or, at least it should certainly not be done on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; false altar of making Windows-use better/easier. OPAM is a source-based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; package manager - OCaml itself requires a bash-like environment to
</I>&gt;<i> compile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (for *all* Windows ports, including the Microsoft-based ones) and let's
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forget that a possible bash-free alternative for building OCaml was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subsequently removed from the source tree. And that's before looking at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packages - it's na&#239;ve to imagine, given the majority of package authors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being Unix-based in one flavour or another, that there will ever a point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where anything approaching a majority of package build systems are
</I>&gt;<i> totally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shell-agnostic. It seems to me to be much better to head towards a system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which can expect various standard Unix commands to be available (via
</I>&gt;<i> Cygwin,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MSYS, GnuWin32, etc.) but aim not to require the actual shell to be Unix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e. work within Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.). In this model, the
</I>&gt;<i> aim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is to make Windows sufficiently Unix-like so that supporting Windows
</I>&gt;<i> becomes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a matter of small configure-style tweaks already required to support
</I>&gt;<i> various
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flavours of Unix anyway. In my experience, packages which end up with two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build systems (the main one, and something hacked for Windows) end up
</I>&gt;<i> with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very stale, broken Windows build system, because the maintainer quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonably ends up releasing later versions without testing whether the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows build system still works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Test &amp; fix on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Cygwin, then, maybe, native.&quot; I'm afraid implies a crucial
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of how OCaml-on-Windows works. I haven't checked, but OPAM should already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compile for *Cygwin* because Cygwin is simply Unix. The only thing which
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be broken is the odd configure check (i.e. correctly parsing the output
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uname). But understand that that means compiling OPAM in *Cygwin*'s OCaml
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which is OCaml built using ./configure in the normal way, not by using
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual files in config/). Having OPAM working for Cygwin is a good idea,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indeed it'd be a good to have a Cygwin package of OPAM if someone were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willing to maintain it. But it's a trivial target - virtually nothing
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require altering, because that's the point of Cygwin. So it's either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;native&quot; (i.e. the MinGW and MSVC ports) or not really worth talking
</I>&gt;<i> about!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The four Windows ports are cross-compiled using a Cygwin bash shell as
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *environment* (note that a lot of this can be done using an MSYS bash
</I>&gt;<i> shell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the environment too). But the compilers are all cross-compilers
</I>&gt;<i> (although
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the architecture for both compilation and target is the same,
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configure scripts do not realise that they are cross compiling!) - which
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why the build system can use things like &quot;/bin/sh&quot; (which Cygwin C
</I>&gt;<i> runtime
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translates it) but the resulting OCaml environment cannot (because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft Visual C Runtime, unsurprisingly, does not).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fortunately, it's easy to interact with Cygwin commands (rm, cp, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because they're all coded to recognise Windows paths if they're specified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with forward slashes (C:/Windows\system32 is a perfectly valid Windows
</I>&gt;<i> path
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and, indeed, for the Command Interpreter, even C:/&quot;W&quot;indows\&quot;&quot;system32
</I>&gt;<i> is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; valid path!).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My experience (based on my own installation of around 45 or so OCaml and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OCaml-related packages) is that building for Windows usually just
</I>&gt;<i> involves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overriding some lazy assumptions in build systems (for example, the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; common one being the assumption &quot;we're building on Windows&quot; =&gt; &quot;object
</I>&gt;<i> files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end in .obj&quot;) so nothing which can't be quickly committed upstream, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applied in opam-repository patches. I don't expect there will be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;generic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixes, beyond trying to cp &quot;foo.exe&quot; if &quot;foo&quot; cannot be found in a
</I>&gt;<i> .install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file (which I'm coding up anyway in my fork). What may be useful is to
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain non-OCaml packages packaged up in OPAM for Windows-only - for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, openssl, pcre and so on to deal with libraries which aren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normally packaged for Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Related to this, are there general plans at the moment for how OPAM may
</I>&gt;<i> deal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with cross-compiling? This becomes relevant with four Windows ports -
</I>&gt;<i> one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the big advantages with opam (and the whole model of opam config env) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it will make it much easier to run all four Windows ports on the
</I>&gt;<i> same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine, but it seems very tedious (and difficult to maintain) to need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specify every single compiler switch 5 times (e.g. 4.02.0, 4.02.0+msvc,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.02.0+mingw, 4.02.0+msvc64, 4.02.0+mingw64). I was thinking of adding a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows-only (for now) --target option to opam switch for an enumeration
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; auto/mingw/msvc/mingw64/msvc64. So opam switch 4.02.0+foo
</I>&gt;<i> --target=mingw64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would build the 64-bit MinGW port of OCaml in
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.opam/4.02.0+foo+mingw64. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would obviously also be useful for opam files to be able to reference the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value of --target.
