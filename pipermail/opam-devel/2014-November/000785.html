<PRE>Le lundi 27 octobre 2014, 10:24:12 Guillaume Claret a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The Coq theorem prover is facing the same challenges as OCaml to 
</I>&gt;<i> distribute and share its contributions. OPAM is a successful initiative 
</I>&gt;<i> for OCaml, so we would be pleased to use it as well. Thanks for this 
</I>&gt;<i> software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Knowing that OPAM is successful also for managing Coq packages will make me very happy. Please share on your experience and possible improvements !

&gt;<i>    Things are still in development and not publicly released, but here 
</I>&gt;<i> are what we have for Coq:
</I>&gt;<i> * a website: <A HREF="http://clarus.github.io/coq-eggs-test/">http://clarus.github.io/coq-eggs-test/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> * a bench system: <A HREF="http://coq-bench.github.io/">http://coq-bench.github.io/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> * four repositories:
</I>&gt;<i>    * stable packages: <A HREF="https://github.com/coq/repo-stable.git">https://github.com/coq/repo-stable.git</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    * beta packages: <A HREF="https://github.com/coq/repo-testing.git">https://github.com/coq/repo-testing.git</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    * development packages: <A HREF="https://github.com/coq/repo-unstable.git">https://github.com/coq/repo-unstable.git</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    * development versions of Coq: <A HREF="https://github.com/coq/repo-coqs.git">https://github.com/coq/repo-coqs.git</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Something we wonder is how to prevent name collisions with the OCaml 
</I>&gt;<i> packages. Some kind of namespace would be the solution. As a convention, 
</I>&gt;<i> we propose to use the &quot;:&quot; separator, like in Docker. So a package on the 
</I>&gt;<i> Coq repository would be of name: &quot;coq:ssreflect&quot; instead of just 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ssreflect&quot;. We could go even further and use the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;coq:big-project-name:small-part-of-it&quot; scheme for big projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Do you think it is a good practice and will the &quot;:&quot; symbol remain 
</I>&gt;<i> handled in names by OPAM? Could we reserve the &quot;coq:&quot; prefix on the 
</I>&gt;<i> OCaml repo to make sure no one is allowed to publish a package with this 
</I>&gt;<i> prefix?
</I>
Sounds like a neat idea, and I don't see how that could become a problem. It'll just be slightly heavier for handling Coq packages I guess.

On the compilers-as-packages: what that would allow you to do is define, on the coq-eggs repo, &quot;compiler&quot; definitions which are just a reference to a given OCaml package and a given Coq package. This'll give you more stability (Coq won't change version or be recompiled) and make the coq dependency implicit in all packages.

The usage would be a bit different in this case: coq-eggs would become a self-contained repo rather than stack over the default OPAM repo for OCaml, and you could even rely on an external OCaml compiler and just specify Coq as &quot;compiler&quot;. For this you might actually want a specific OPAM instance and opam root, e.g. ~/.coq-opam, that may coexist alongside an OCaml's ~/.opam.

Not sure how that would be an improvement on the current repo though, I'd be happy to know what you think. 

Cheers,
Louis
