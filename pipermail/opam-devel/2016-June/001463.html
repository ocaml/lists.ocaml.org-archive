</I>
Nice fix,  I'd gladly merge the PR

For lib-ext... well, we needed a build system:
- for OCaml
- with no dependencies

and it's just to bootstrap. Yes obviously, lib-ext is an ugly hack, and I am 
not proud of it; the doc+Makefiles makes sure you only use it for building the 
opam binary and not for usable libraries though

The previous solution was cleaner, but relied on ocp-build. Migrating to 
OCamlMakefile was a painful experience, but I can't see a better option 
around. Also, it manages to not be too much trouble to maintain.

It could actually make sense to have a real bootstrap and use a local opam 
repo; but this has big downsides as well.

&gt;<i> I then hacked admin-scripts/compilers-to-packages.ml and changed the
</I>&gt;<i> #directory entries to include src/{core,repository,format,tools} and
</I>&gt;<i> src_ext and can run that script which I used to replicate the next branch
</I>&gt;<i> on opam-repository and so rebased to create
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/dra27/opam-repository/tree/next-windows">https://github.com/dra27/opam-repository/tree/next-windows</A> (I've been doing
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of work locally, which is why it's lagging behind master at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment).
</I>
Yes, not very friendly, but that's how I do that kind of thing at the moment

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now, for scripts that get generally useful and somewhat stable, it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; perfectly fine to migrate them to be part of opam-admin. Moving the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; scripts to their own repo would also be fine if they reach a critical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weight.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Should we improve compat of the Makefile and/or move the 1.2-&gt;2.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; functionality to opam-admin ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the purposes of container-based testing, it would be great if we could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move the essential functionality into `opam admin` directly.  This will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let me insert in the right `git clone / opam admin upgrade` runs into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CI scripts so that OPAM 2 is easy to test for end users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> compilers-to-packages.ml will be a one-time thing, though, surely? Once OPAM
</I>&gt;<i> 2 goes live, surely the main repository will need to work in reverse,
</I>&gt;<i> back-porting an OPAM 1.x.y repository?
</I>
Yes, at some point will have to switch the version of submissions to opam-
repository.
