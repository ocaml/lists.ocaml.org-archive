<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. Make package installation sandboxed in such a way that just installing a
</I>&gt;<i> package is harmless as long as its code is not linked and run. (Of course
</I>&gt;<i> this code may be linked and run if a developer also makes a typo in its
</I>&gt;<i> software.)
</I>
This is already possible, but Linux-only, and requires a local setup (opam 
allows wrappers for package commands, and I wrote some scripts based on Linux 
namespaces to restrict network and FS access. Not quite secure at the moment 
but could be made so). I intended this mainly for CI (and paranoid users), and 
am already using it locally.

&gt;<i> So my question: where in the opam-repository QA process should I add a
</I>&gt;<i> script (preferably written in OCaml rather than shell) that gets the name
</I>&gt;<i> of the packages proposed for inclusion, also has access to the name of
</I>&gt;<i> existing packages in the repository, and can fail or warn if the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> one is typo-close to an existing one?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (This test can have false positives, eg. installing lablgtk2 when lablgtk
</I>&gt;<i> exists. It should still fail in a visible way in the UI, but not in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that prevent other, more advanced tests, such as package installability.)
</I>
My intention was to add a function for this kind of package/repo checks in 
src/state/opamFileTools.ml, taking an additional switch_state as parameter, 
and returning type as `lint`. Then opamMain can (optionally ?) load a state 
and aggregate the results before printing.

Thanks !

&gt;<i> Hi opam-devel,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a rather cool bachelor thesis that seems relevant to OPAM
</I>&gt;<i> repository management:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Typosquatting in Programming Language Package Managers
</I>&gt;<i>   Nikolai Philipp Tschacher, March 2016
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://incolumitas.com/2016/06/08/typosquatting-package-managers/">http://incolumitas.com/2016/06/08/typosquatting-package-managers/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The described attack is to propose packages whose names are typo-close to
</I>&gt;<i> very popular packages. Instead of &quot;opam install omake&quot; I run &quot;opam install
</I>&gt;<i> omaek&quot;, but &quot;omaek&quot; exists and is attacker-controlled, and its install
</I>&gt;<i> script wreaks havoc on my machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is interesting because it is a way to subvert a specific package that
</I>&gt;<i> is immune to the common defenses against impersonation -- signing a package
</I>&gt;<i> with its maintainers keys, etc. The author of the thesis suggests three
</I>&gt;<i> defense methods:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Alert repository administrators when a typo-candidate is proposed for
</I>&gt;<i> integration. (This is especially relevant for repositories with no human
</I>&gt;<i> oversight on package addition, but even for OPAM one may consider that the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers themselves may be fooled by the typo or not think of the
</I>&gt;<i> security consequences.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Keep a log of the non-existing packages that users commonly try to
</I>&gt;<i> install (good candidates for typos) and alert administrators when a
</I>&gt;<i> matching package is proposed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure that the systems expert in the room have plans for (1) already. I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that opam's architecture does not let us do (3), but I was
</I>&gt;<i> interesting in quickly hacking (2) this morning -- I suppose I like
</I>&gt;<i> typo-detection stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My plan was: in `opam lint`, emit a warning if the linted package name is
</I>&gt;<i> at edit distance 2 or less (but not 0) of an existing package in the
</I>&gt;<i> repository. But this does not quite work; I quickly looked at the code and
</I>&gt;<i> it seems that &quot;opam lint&quot; is meant to be run purely locally, it does not
</I>&gt;<i> have access to a base of packages available in the repository.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I></PRE>
