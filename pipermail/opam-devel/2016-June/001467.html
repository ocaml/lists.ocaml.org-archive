<PRE>&gt;<i> Biggest feedback at the moment is that compilers-as-a-package is a fabulous
</I>&gt;<i> innovation &#8211; I had originally expected to need to add lots of horrid
</I>&gt;<i> Windows (and OCaml, therefore)-specific stuff to the OPAM program, but in
</I>&gt;<i> fact all I've had to do is add generic features to OPAM and then handle the
</I>&gt;<i> rest in the package itself, which is great!
</I>
That's good to hear :)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; The &quot;target-filename&quot; part being optional. See for example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev/packages/ocaml/ocaml.4.01.0+BER/opam">http://opam.ocaml.org/2.0~dev/packages/ocaml/ocaml.4.01.0+BER/opam</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ta, I came across it subsequently too! I've extended it (or rather, will
</I>&gt;<i> shortly extend it), to allow it to refer to the URL of another package, as
</I>&gt;<i> the ocaml package needs to pick up the sources of the flexdll package
</I>&gt;<i> installed just before it in order to bootstrap correctly.
</I> 
Hm, that seems a bit ad-hoc and introduces metadata dependencies of a new 
kind. What if flexdll has a git url or is pinned locally ?

&gt;<i> I've gone with the command line options for now (with an error check to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that they're only given when installing a switch). At the moment,
</I>&gt;<i> they define three global variables switch-cc, switch-libc and switch-arch
</I>&gt;<i> which are only available during the switch installation, so if they want to
</I>&gt;<i> be kept, the compiler package has to capture them in its own .config file.
</I>&gt;<i> ocaml.system remains a horrible hack under this mechanism (the script
</I>&gt;<i> identifies that it's in a switch named &quot;system&quot; and uses that fact to probe
</I>&gt;<i> switch-cc, switch-libc, and switch-arch...)
</I>
That would likely break `opam switch foo --alias-of system`. Adding `--set-
variables &lt;bindings&gt;` to `opam switch install` would be a good first step, and 
if we find suitable sugar later on we may add it.
 
&gt;<i> It's not particularly pretty, but it does seem to work in the absence of
</I>&gt;<i> something more general for now. In particular, I've restructured the base
</I>&gt;<i> packages and added a package called compiler whose purpose is to store
</I>&gt;<i> variables (in particular, compiler:o, compiler:so and compiler:a giving
</I>&gt;<i> important file extensions for object files, etc., which are necessary for
</I>&gt;<i> writing generic package specifications). The only bug I had to fix with
</I>&gt;<i> that so far is to thread the config files correctly through parallel_apply
</I>&gt;<i> (before they were only re-loaded at the end of the installation), but there
</I>&gt;<i> is a comment in the code that you already aware of problems there!
</I>
hm, forgot about that TBH, I'll need to check :) 

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, just philosophical, there is no constraint here besides the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I don't want to recompile the compiler, ever&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've spent the last couple of days working through this, and I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> definitely worth relaxing that restriction. I've altered opam switch so
</I>&gt;<i> that only the root package is the compiler package &#8211; so only ocaml.version
</I>&gt;<i> is in the compiler section of switch-state. Have a look at this
</I>&gt;<i> transcript:
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That seems a potentially very useful thing to be able to do &#8211; and you don't
</I>&gt;<i> lose the safety of the &quot;compiler&quot; packages &#8211; opam remove flexdll (or
</I>&gt;<i> base-unix, etc.) will still complain that this would involve removing the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler:
</I> 
&gt;<i> [opam:4.02.0] [git:windows] C:\DRA\opam\src&gt;opam remove flexdll
</I>&gt;<i> Your request can't be satisfied:
</I>&gt;<i>   - Package ocaml is part of the base for this compiler and can't be
</I>&gt;<i> changed
</I> 
&gt;<i> No solution found, exiting
</I>
Note, though that even with the current system, the restriction that compiler 
packages are immutable is somewhat lifted if you pin the package: so the above 
should work without changes (I haven't tested pinning one package of the 
&quot;compiler packages&quot; set and recompiling its compiler dependents though)
