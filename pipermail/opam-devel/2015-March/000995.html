great to hear.

&gt;<i> # Proposal (just random remarks)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Threat model: * an attacker can compromise the repository
</I>
what does this mean? as mentioned, I'd prefer to have the repository
being untrusted.

&gt;<i> Package signature: this should probably sign over * the package
</I>&gt;<i> definition, excluding the url file (everything under
</I>&gt;<i> `~repo/packages/&lt;pkg&gt;/&lt;pkg&gt;.&lt;version&gt;/`) * the upstream package
</I>&gt;<i> archive (and possibly its url and mirrors ?)
</I>
I'd hash all the files of the package definition, and the tarball, and
keep a list in the file &quot;checksums&quot;:
&lt;name&gt;,&lt;size&gt;,[&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;,&lt;hash-value&gt;]+

thus, replacement (or multiple) hash algorithms can be used. the
&lt;checksum&gt; in url is no longer needed.

let's start with SHA-256. signature is made on the SHA-256 hash of
&quot;checksums&quot;.

&gt;<i> Key delegation: * We can simply delegate to sub-directories of the
</I>&gt;<i> repository * OPAM should probably be changed not to accept package
</I>&gt;<i> definitions anywhere in the hierarchy then (I _think_
</I>&gt;<i> `~repo/foo/foo.1/bar.1/` would work as a definition for `bar.1` at
</I>&gt;<i> the moment, OPAM makes no assumptions on the hierarchy)
</I>
both good points.

&gt;<i> Root key: * TUF propoposes several root keys with a threshold. That
</I>&gt;<i> could be a nice security since it makes revocation of root keys
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>
agreed.

&gt;<i> claimed/unclaimed/recently claimed maintainer keys (from Python's
</I>&gt;<i> pep480): * I think we'll need some kind of 'unclaimed' at least to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure the progressive migration to signed packages, having all
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers sign up-front before rolling 1.3 sounds difficult. Then
</I>&gt;<i> we don't have Pypi's flow of incoming packages, so we may not need
</I>&gt;<i> as much infrastructure -- having a default delegated maintainer
</I>&gt;<i> could be enough.
</I>
true.

&gt;<i> Timestamp server: * I'd love to see that done by a unikernel that
</I>&gt;<i> fetches from github, signs, then pushes back to the repository HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> server. Still needs to get its key from somewhere though.
</I>
in fact, that was my idea as well.

&gt;<i> # open questions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Allowing non-maintainer updates: I have been wondering about this
</I>&gt;<i> as well. It's not easy, and modification of dependency constraints
</I>&gt;<i> can be an attack vector already (adding a dep to a compromised
</I>&gt;<i> package, or even an unsafe older package version). Sometimes, there
</I>&gt;<i> is also a trivial packaging bug, and the repository maintainers
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to fix it if the package maintainer is not
</I>&gt;<i> responsive enough. We could try and detect 'innocuous' changes, but
</I>&gt;<i> that sounds like something that can get too complex very quickly
</I>&gt;<i> and will open more weaknesses. No better solution than letting the
</I>&gt;<i> modified package get signed by a general repository maintainer,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe with a time window for the rightful owner to sign it ? I'll
</I>&gt;<i> think some more about it.
</I>
sounds good.

&gt;<i> * opam-publish: I'd like to see it get more widely used. Maybe I
</I>&gt;<i> should make it more clear that the first step (`opam publish
</I>&gt;<i> prepare`) only gathers metadata locally and is very generic, while
</I>&gt;<i> the second (`opam publish submit`) is github specific and bound to
</I>&gt;<i> opam-repository by default. Anyway, the signing process will be
</I>&gt;<i> open and should be reproducible by hand, with minimum hassle. But
</I>&gt;<i> having opam-publish generate, and manage keys would be a definite
</I>&gt;<i> gain in usability IMO.
</I>
it should prepare &quot;checksums&quot;

&gt;<i> * dependencies to command-line utilities: OPAM's parallel command
</I>&gt;<i> engine relies on parallelism at the sub-process level (we don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to embed lwt into OPAM); but having our own download handling
</I>&gt;<i> would certainly help with several issues, also including
</I>&gt;<i> portability.
</I>
and running opam within a unikernel :)

&gt;<i> # some more * Would we want to use the TUF specified json format ?
</I>
or sexp, since that's already a first-class citizen!

&gt;<i> * Last, I'd like your advice and opinion on the algorithms and
</I>&gt;<i> signing to use. Small elliptic-curve based signature (ed25519) seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be all the hype now with stuff like signify or minilock. What is
</I>&gt;<i> the state of what we currently have in native OCaml, and what would
</I>&gt;<i> you recommend ?
</I>
this whole minilock seems to be a not-yet-though-out-idea (looking
into the thread
<A HREF="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2015/001559.html">https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2015/001559.html</A>)

what we have
- - cryptokit (RSA/DH/hashes)
- - cryptohash (hashes)
- - ocaml-sha (sha)
- - ocaml-nocrypto (RSA/DH/DSA/hashes)
- - ocaml-sodium (bindings to libsodium/nacl [curve 25519])

what I'd recommend: be agile! use a keytype and keydata field --
initially support both RSA and ED25519 keys (I believe PyPi people did
the same).
