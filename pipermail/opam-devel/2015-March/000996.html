yes. hash and size should be signed!

</I>
if we use email as identification, opam can notify the package
maintainer via email, including instructions what to do if
agree/disagree with the change.

&gt;&gt;<i> * We should require maintainers to sign their packages -&gt; the

</I>
I'd leave pins to git+ssh for now alone.. using signed commits open
another whole can of worms.

&gt;<i> One note about that, I'm personally not very cryptographically

</I>&gt;<i> one of my fear in all this, there's already so much publication

</I>
I'm currently eager to propose unencrypted private keys (valid for
maybe a year, thus we get key rollovers) and having revocation baked
in, thus a compromise of a key can be mitigated easily (and no need
for *-agent). Using the same key for encryption and signing is a bad idea.
