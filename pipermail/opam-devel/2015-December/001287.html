&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Louis.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of this sounds very good. I'd just like to report 3 more features
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; various people have told me about this last months:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1/ `opam bundle`: it seems that a few existing projects don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> tell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their users to install OCaml and opam. They just want a stand-alone
</I>&gt;<i> tarball
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you can decompress and run `configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install`.
</I>&gt;<i> There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are already some patches from @ygrek doing this, that would be very cool
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrate the tool upstream
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, indeed; these patches should be made easier by the reorganised
</I>&gt;<i> opam-lib (I
</I>&gt;<i> remember there were issues with e.g. OpamArg). I'll see with @ygrek once
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> current refactoring is done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2/ local switch/root. few people reported that they would like to use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per-project opam root. This could be done easily by making the CLI check
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a `.opam` directory in parent directories. Or it could work with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local config switch file (now that we have only one config file per
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch), stored in the repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not, this sounds like a very easy one, at least with the first option
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> are there cases where this might get confusing ? The second one would allow
</I>&gt;<i> sharing of repositories and `opam update` across &quot;per-project switches&quot;, it
</I>&gt;<i> boils down to &quot;allow creating a switch with the prefix I supply&quot; --
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> that I intended to add already, the `opam switch` interface needing to be
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten anyway, since compilers turned into packages -- and some magic to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically choose &quot;current switch&quot; based on PWD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this will only work for opam commands, and you still need to `eval
</I>&gt;<i> $(opam config env)`, which really isn't a huge benefit compared to `eval
</I>&gt;<i> $(opam config env --root/--switch xxx)` that you need without a specific
</I>&gt;<i> feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the best answer to these use-cases is clearly opam-manager [1],
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> was designed for this purpose: it can dynamically choose opam root and
</I>&gt;<i> switch
</I>&gt;<i> based on `.opam-switch` files found in ancestors of PWD, and more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly,
</I>&gt;<i> installs dispatchers for binaries that make them transparent -- without
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> for `config env`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1]: <A HREF="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-manager">https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-manager</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3/ local remotes. Currently the remote are per-switch which make them a
</I>&gt;<i> bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; annoying when you have a repo with dev packages. Currently it's easier to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; share a list of pins that a remote. So maybe extend `opam pin` to allow
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take file of packages to pin -- actually it could already work with `opam
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch import`, so maybe it's just a matter of documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's on my list too, but I delayed it until I finish refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> OpamState
</I>&gt;<i> -- it's tempting to change everything at once, but often a bad idea. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> sure it will make it for 1.3 though, although, since it will require yet
</I>&gt;<i> another format change to ~/.opam, it may be better to have all these
</I>&gt;<i> changes
</I>&gt;<i> at once. In my new version repository state is completely decoupled from
</I>&gt;<i> switch state, so the work will mostly be on how to define the repository
</I>&gt;<i> state
</I>&gt;<i> in the ~/.opam layout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And last big item, that I haven't seen in your list: windows support: is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this still on the map?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I consider it a parallel branch of work, so it may not be synchronised
</I>&gt;<i> with 1.3, but effort is being put into this too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Ashish Agarwal -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi. Thanks for this nice summary and ongoing work. Is there any support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; planned for installing binaries? What is needed is a way to specify a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different tarball depending on the detected architecture. I know some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people want this for OCaml packages, but actually I'm interested in it
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our non-OCaml biopam repo [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did not put this on the list, but have been thinking about it for a
</I>&gt;<i> while.
</I>&gt;<i> Once we have tracking of packages' files, extracting that info to generate
</I>&gt;<i> binary packages, or even a full opam repository of binary packages, would
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> easy. There are many dark corners though, that may not be a problem for
</I>&gt;<i> biocaml:
</I>&gt;<i> - optional dependencies: you need to choose whether you want them before
</I>&gt;<i> generating the binaries, obviously
</I>&gt;<i> - ocaml is not relocatable, which is a big issue, although we have
</I>&gt;<i> proposed a
</I>&gt;<i> compiler patch a while ago and have some hacks available [2]
</I>&gt;<i> - there are actually different approaches available, depending on whether
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> just want to cache builds, you want to distribute a bundle, or you want a
</I>&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;<i> binary repository
</I>&gt;<i> - local setup, external dependencies, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But some stuff on this front is to be expected too!
