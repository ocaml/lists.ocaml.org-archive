<PRE>Great.

In addition, I wonder if we can try to do some testing of the setup as part
of the testing of updates to the opam metadata.  Right now, for example,
emacs just errors out on startup in some cases.  Having a test of
user-setup that verified some basic functionality would be really nice.

</I>&gt;<i> have made it yet into opam, so that might be the cause of your trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we are far from there, and we have had a few successful

</I>&gt;<i> few improvements pending, which I'll get into opam-repo ASAP. One of them

</I>&gt;<i> ~/.emacs.d/opam-user-setup.el.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another thing about user-setup is that its operations are only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implicit, i.e., it only does things on install, which means if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to do something like set up a clean .emacs file, or even just get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a list of the things it's doing, there's no obvious way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, as of now its only &quot;interface&quot; is with opam. The new version
</I>&gt;<i> should display some information about what files it is updating, at least
</I>&gt;<i> on newer opam, but that's a bare minimum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be ideal if user-setup came with a command-line tool, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually if it only modified files after you called that command-line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tool, which would warn you about what it was going to do, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even give you a way of immediately unrolling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed; the command-line tool is currently very limited in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> interaction, as it's designed to be run from opam, but that would be well
</I>&gt;<i> worth improving. At least having it list its current status when run
</I>&gt;<i> without arguments would be quite helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll look into this.
