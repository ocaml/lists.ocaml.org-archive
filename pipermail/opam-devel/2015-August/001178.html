Here's a followup OCaml 4.02.3 patch that is now suitable for wider testing.
I've run it on amd64 and sparc64 and am doing a complete bulk rebuild that isn't
complete yet.

Full patch: <A HREF="http://www.recoil.org/~avsm/openbsd-patches/ocaml-4.02.3-2.patch.txt">http://www.recoil.org/~avsm/openbsd-patches/ocaml-4.02.3-2.patch.txt</A>

Diffstat is fairly large as I took the opportunity to do version upgrade on 
most of the small library ports.  The biggest upgrade is to OPAM 1.2.2, and
using the online solver by default rather than the now-broken internal solver.
Unfortunately, porting Aspcud requires Bison 2.25 or higher in our ports tree;
is anyone working on that for OpenBSD?

This mail should be CCed to all the MAINTAINER folk listed in the various
ports.  Testing on ARM would be appreciated in particular, and i386.
