Subject: [opam-devel] re. local roots/switches: Documentation for the
 "nix-style" new-build approach in Cabal
Message-ID: <CAPFanBFhKUygPEL269M3bRPAVPV-V7aQ50Q8s+iE+LgBcTXYFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi opam-devel,

You may be interested in this document being elaborated by Edward Yang
as part of his work "cabal new-build" that is described as a
"nix-style local build" for cabal (a core Haskell tool that is on the
crossroad between opam and oasis and ocamlbuild, and as you could
guess has unsatisfied users on all three of these fronts). It could be
interesting and inspirational with respect to the discussion on
workflows for local roots or local switches in opam.

  Cabal User Guide: Nix-style local builds
  http://ezyang.com/nix-local-build.html

(Other tools of interest from other communities would be Haskell's
"stack" and Rust's "cargo", but they differ and are interesting in
many broader, less well-defined aspects of the user experience, and I
have no personal experience with them.)

One aspect of the tool exhibited in this document that I found
interesting is that the design and user experience is not concentrated
on a "local root to develop a new package" workflow, but "local root
to develop a set of related packages together" workflow :
multi-package. There is a conceptual difference between the "local
packages" in this set and the "external packages" that are expected to
remain stable during development (in general).

To my knowledge there is no such established multi-package concept in
related OCaml tooling these days, and there are cases where we don't
do very well on this workflow. For example, Thomas Gazagnaire and
J?r?mie Dimino have ocamlbuild plugins to rebuild the project when
ocamlfind dependencies changed that are very important in this
workflow, but currently not part of the default tool (
https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/issues/91 ). It mostly affect
aspects of the user experience that are outside of opam's domain, but
I think it may still be a relevant distinction for opam.

Having a switch shared by the packages you are developing each one of these being git-pinned in it fits the bill for me.

The only remaining problem is that our build systems are too stupid to track dependencies up to the installed package (in fact, libraries) they use in the builds. This means local repo dev builds don't know they need to recompile when one of the git-pinned (or any other) package reinstalled.

Best, 

Daniel

IIRC, this was particularly relevant for the opam sub-domain, so cc-ing the
opam-devel list. Can any opam dev please confirm. If it is still needed, we
should act quick to update this.

That's correct -- the current Gandi SSL certificate had a few subdomains to
deal with as well, so all of those need to be renewed.

I've been experimenting with Letsencrypt on a few other domains, and it
is mostly working fine except that certificates are only issued for 90 days.
This means that it's essential to implement autorenewal via the Acme API,
or else domains will expire rather rapidly.

This is generally a good excuse to examine the state of the various
infrastructures to determine how auto-update friendly they all are. There
is an ocaml-acme client under development at:
https://github.com/mmaker/ocaml-acme
...but it requires a release of OCaml-X509 to expose some extra CSR
information.  Hannes, is there a release of that scheduled, or should I
look at an alternative mechanism for our auto-updated certs?

Happily, this businessman is still administering the servers, albeit with
a slightly higher latency...

Anil

I'm positive you need secure connections for lists.ocaml.org as well
(to protect the passwords of list administrators and subscribers).

Now that Anil is a successful businessman, who is administering the
*.ocaml.org Web servers and DNS ?

FYI, if you go the Gandi renewal way, it costs 200 Eur for 3 years,
and one of the three validation methods below may have to be
implemented.

- Xavier Leroy

Validation by DNS record Validation by DNS record implies that you have
access to the DNS zone file of your domain, and can add a record to it. If
you opt for this method, the record to be inserted into the zone will be
displayed on the following page.

Validation by email This validation method is simple, though requires that
you have an email address available for for each domain validated. This
email address must be created with the user admin@ (ex.: if you want to
validate the domain example.com, you must create the email address
admin at example.com). If you did not get the validation email, go to your
validation status interface and relaunch the sending of the verification emails.

Validation by file This validation method requires that you have access to
the server that hosts the website that the domain will point to. You are
asked to copy a TXT file that contains a verification key, and to place it
at the root directory of the website. If you don't have the hosting set up
for your site, or if you don't have access to the root directory, then
choose another validation method. Warning: Your .TXT file should only be
available through HTTP. The validation will not work with HTTPS redirection.

Had a look at this. It seems rather toyish at the moment and makes me wonder a bit about programmers building security infrastructure on top of libraries with obvious security risks...

Is there something specific in OCaml-Acme that worries you, or is this a general existential crisis about the state of software security that you are experiencing?

I'm perfectly relaxed, thank you. Daniel is pretty good at spotting fatal flaws in software, so I'd like to clarify his opinion before reconstructing our SSL infrastructure.

Xavier, it may be better just to renew with Gandi TLS for another year, to give us a bit more time to move over to a properly rotated Letsencrypt.org base over the course of the year.

Anil

Only waiting for people being sorry for using a library that doesn't check the validity of the underlying encoding it is supposed to assert.

All right, I somehow misinterpreted the tone of your message, as it
often happens in written communication. Sorry for the noise! :)

There no bug to be reported, it's by design. You should read the documentation of the libraries you are using.

Could you please elaborate on the design problem? I believe the
project has an issue tracker where you can report constructive
feedback about any design issues you encounter.

This refers to the internal string representation. It's not clear to
me why or how this will result in users "being sorry" for using a
library in order to get a certificate from a (trusted) CA. I think the
author of the library might like to understand more about why you
think this might be a problem so that they can correct it. Telling
them is certainly more effective (and socially responsible) than
spreading FUD on an unrelated mailing list.

But maybe if you call your module Safe, it is; Yosjon.Safe.of_string. After all insecurity is only a feeling. It's hilarious.  

Frankly simply don't use the wrong tools; I don't claim there are no bugs in jsonm but at least it doesn't try to be insecure by design. I think that if you are implementing security infrastructure you should be careful about these details; as far as I'm concerned not doing so casts some doubts on your ability to actually implement these things.

Any yojson user might end up being sorry at some point and I have said this for a long time [1]. There are quite a few scenarios where you could be bitten by this behaviour since it invalidates invariants you may think hold about a string that was decoded about a standard compliant JSON parser (like absence of NULL byte in the original string -- note that decoded strings reencoded to UTF-8 may have null bytes because U+0000 is allowed via *escape*). Now store that original string somewhere and think about the fact that most OCaml's system APIs were vulnerable to NULL byte injection until recently (and I'm sure a lot of other C bindings are).

I'm not spreading FUD I'm talking about a reality, on mailing list were this project was mentioned to be used. And sorry I don't have time to loose with random people toying in a random, unreleased, github repository.

> I still don't think you've demonstrated insecurity (except perhaps your own).


Security is a mindset. You are showing that you are not having it and I personally feel that neither does an individual that uses insecure libraries to build security infrastructure. Now trust who you want I just happens that I have different expectations about the quality of the code I use.

>From the yojson docs:

Note that yojson never checks the encoding of strings. All
ASCII-compatible encodings including UTF-8 are supported by yojson
readers and writers. Non-ASCII-compatible encodings UTF-16BE,
UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE are not supported. "\uXXXX" escape
sequences are converted by the readers into the equivalent UTF-8
multibyte sequences. Characters outside the ASCII range are always
written as is, as permitted by the JSON standard. Bytes that do not
form valid UTF-8 characters are also output as is. It is the user's
responsibility to check for the correctness of UTF-8 data when
appropriate.

There are quite a few scenarios where you could be bitten by this behaviour since it invalidates invariants you may think hold about a string that was decoded about a standard compliant JSON parser (like absence of NULL byte in the original string -- note that decoded strings reencoded to UTF-8 may have null bytes because U+0000 is allowed via *escape*). Now store that original string somewhere and think about the fact that most OCaml's system APIs were vulnerable to NULL byte injection until recently (and I'm sure a lot of other C bindings are).

The attack you are partially describing would be the ACME CA sending
you malicious JSON. This seems fairly unlikely and in violation of the
trust model of the CA system, though, I admit, it is possible. It is
likely that the author of the library is not aware of these facts
which is why I continue to urge you to help them understand the
issues.

You are sending messages containing unsubstantiated security claims
which result in fear (probably overblown), uncertainty (because the
claims have no demonstration), and doubt (about the author's "ability
to actually implement these things"). I find it quite something that
your original messages were vague to the point of useless but now you
have expended far more effort justifying your opinion than would have
been required to help the project.

Security is also an economic proposition and a community effort. A CA
attacking you is possible but unlikely. Helping others to develop
secure software is beneficial to all the users of that software. We
are talking about a project that is *already written in OCaml* so it
is unlikely that the author is incapable of building excellent
software in the short to medium term.

It's interesting that defending against knee-jerk FUD attacks is not
compatible with a "security mindset". I think that a blanket dismissal
of the library (and its author) due to the adoption of a widespread
(though fraught) library is absurd. It is very likely the author does
not know the things you know and does not have the experience with
yojson or the OCaml community that you have. Clearly they are
interested in security and clearly they have produced something of
value even if not perfect (it's unreleased!).

So precisely: it will decode a lot of things the string production of RFC 7159 would not decode (it's not only about UTF-8 validity, you are not supposed to have control characters in encoded json text). I'm not demonstrating an attack but I precisely think that security is one of these topics were you don't want to "do it like this until proven otherwise". If you like it that way so be it, but stop accusing me of FUD. When you implement a standard that refers to others final correctness is assumed given the other standards being implemented correctly, weakest link bla bla.

I'm not describing an attack I'm describing an attack *vector* in any program that uses yojson. It may or may not be exploitable, but I absolutely dont care about this: you have the choice of not having this attack vector at all. Given the current trend of security breaches I expect good and responsible programmers to actually make the right choices. 

> You are sending messages containing unsubstantiated security claims
See above. I'm not sending messages about security claims (I'm absolutely not a security expert and not interested beyond what is needed for me to write dependable software users can trust). I'm sending messages about a security mindset; don't use unsecure libraries that can open attack vectors in your programs.

Well I expected you to be a little more subtle than that and to understand the points without having to go that far in this discussion.

Hello,

The odig project [1] stores the files it generates in $(opam config var prefix)/var/cache/odig. An `opam remove odig` will not cleanup that directory, should I do it in the `remove:` section of odig's OPAM file ? 

Best, 

Daniel

If you do, that will be removed on every upgrade of `odig`, which may or not 
be what you want.

I wondered at some point if distinguishing temporary removal (for upgrade) 
from definitive removal in the metadata would be needed, but the question is 
still open. I know `apt-get` has `remove` and `purge` for this.
