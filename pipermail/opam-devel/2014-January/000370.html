To be clear, the reason for OPAM 1.0 to 1.1 being incompatible was &quot;unplanned&quot;.  The original release was too strict with it's parsing, and OPAM 1.1 is now far more lax.

There's also support for the 'repo' file already (in both OPAM 1.0 and 1.1) which allow redirections (as happens with 1.0-&gt;1.1).

All-in-all, we're in pretty good shape for upgrades.  Some features such as multiple archive support need some thought, since changing the type of field could be tricky, but it's not impossible to maintain backwards compatibility.
