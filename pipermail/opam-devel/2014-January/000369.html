<PRE>Another possible solution is to have the repository format include its
version number somewhere. Then make opam always check the version number
and give a useful message if it doesn't know how to deal with the repo
version. The message is &quot;sorry, if you want to use opam.ocaml.org (or
whichever repo it is), then you have to upgrade opam&quot;.

This doesn't provide as smooth of an upgrade path as your proposal, but it
seems easier to implement. Automatically updating opam and updating the
repos a user has configured is likely to be buggy. Also, it is possible
that a single version of opam can work with multiple repo versions.

In all cases, it should be considered that <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org">https://opam.ocaml.org</A> must
remain the main repo URL. It is the nice URL and we don't want to have the
next repo be at <A HREF="https://opam2.ocaml.org.">https://opam2.ocaml.org.</A>

&gt;<i> [I am moving this discussion away from the BTS and into
</I>&gt;<i>  the mailing list, as the issues raised here are of
</I>&gt;<i>  general relevance for the future of Opam, and must
</I>&gt;<i>  not be lost in the middle of other comments; see
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/1149">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/1149</A> for the original
</I>&gt;<i>  discussion
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> Roberto
</I>&gt;<i> ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original issue: what build system should we use to build opam?
</I>&gt;<i> Should we cook up an ad-hoc Makefile, use a patched ocamlbuild,
</I>&gt;<i> or use OCamlMakefile, or use ocp-build? Is it evil to embark
</I>&gt;<i> a build system in the package manager source code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My quick view of these issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) choice of the build system
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      we are already plagued with multiple build systems, and one of the
</I>&gt;<i> reason
</I>&gt;<i>      of opam's success is that it allows every package author the freedom
</I>&gt;<i> to use
</I>&gt;<i>      the one he/she prefers/ is more comfortable with.
</I>&gt;<i>      Opam is no exception, and opam developers must be able to pick the
</I>&gt;<i> build system
</I>&gt;<i>      they prefer, so I would say, it's their decision to make
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) embarking a full build system into the source tree of a package
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      in general I would find this a very bad idea: one should have a
</I>&gt;<i> separate
</I>&gt;<i>      package for the build system, and have it installed before building
</I>&gt;<i> anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Now, what sets opam apart from other OCaml components is the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that it is
</I>&gt;<i>      the *basic* building block for all the other packages in the
</I>&gt;<i> repository, and
</I>&gt;<i>      without a running opam, there is no way to install any other package;
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>      is a bootstrap issue, and that's why, for example, opam embarks in
</I>&gt;<i> src_ext
</I>&gt;<i>      the full source of the dose and libcudf libraries, instead of linking
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i>      the packages for dose and libcudf (that do exist in the repository);
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i>      in this particular case *only* I personally would not be shocked to
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i>      some extra stuff in the src_ext directory (especially considering that
</I>&gt;<i>      all this will need to work on multiple platforms)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3) how do we update opam?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Now, for another important issue, related to the special status of
</I>&gt;<i> opam
</I>&gt;<i>      as *the* package manager, and how we should manage it (hence the title
</I>&gt;<i>      of this message).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I am a bit unhappy with the current state of affairs, where new
</I>&gt;<i>      versions of opam appear with incompatible changes in the repository
</I>&gt;<i> format,
</I>&gt;<i>      hence different versions of the repositories: people using old
</I>&gt;<i> versions
</I>&gt;<i>      of opam get lost in a limbo-like repository with non updated packages
</I>&gt;<i>      until they realise they need to recompile a new version of opam
</I>&gt;<i>      to see the light again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      We need to find a way to have opam become a package like the others
</I>&gt;<i>      (with the exception of the embarked code for bootstrapping reasons),
</I>&gt;<i>      and have it become part of opam-repository... the main difficulty
</I>&gt;<i>      lies in the fact that its binaries need to go in special places,
</I>&gt;<i>      and not in the 4.00/3.12 etc. dirs (correct if I'm wrong)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Once this is done, a sensible upgrade path would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Time T : I have opam version n installed, accessing repo version n
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Time T+delta: some major changes make the old opam unable to use the
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i>                 repository format, and the repository migrates to a new
</I>&gt;<i> place;
</I>&gt;<i>                 a new version n+1 of opam is released, embedding logic to
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i>                 the new repository;
</I>&gt;<i>                 opam version n+1 is added also to repo version n
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Sometimes later: the user of opam n runs an update, sees that a new
</I>&gt;<i>                       version of opam is available, and upgrades it...
</I>&gt;<i>                       he now has the new opam, that updates the references
</I>&gt;<i>                       to the new repository, and keeps following the
</I>&gt;<i> evolution
</I>&gt;<i>                       of the repository, with no pain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       I know that maybe at some point the repo format will stabilise, but
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>       simple process will make sure that the lambda-users (private joke:
</I>&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;<i>       equivalent to &quot;jow of the street&quot; in french, but also hints at
</I>&gt;<i> functional
</I>&gt;<i>       programmers :-)) will not get lost, no matter the changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Any chances to see this happen soon? A starting point would be to
</I>&gt;<i> summarize
</I>&gt;<i>       on this list the difficulties that prevent opam from being a &quot;normal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       package
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
