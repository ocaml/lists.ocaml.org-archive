There are several importabilities that are blocking a port to
MacOS X in the various shell scripts (noted on the GitHub
issue).  I've put my candidate MacOS X port up at:

<A HREF="https://github.com/avsm/homebrew/pull/1">https://github.com/avsm/homebrew/pull/1</A>

However, it still fails due to lacking some of the patches
from the Debian package, and I'd appreciate concrete pointers
to where these files are.  Looking in the Debian binary package
that Roberto pointed to, I find several different patches in
the wheezy and jessie repositories, and the jessie version
has layered ones (for 'trendy' and an external sed script).
Which one are we supposed to be using?

I'd appreciate a unified diff against upstream so that I can
patch the other incompatibilities against a known good base...
