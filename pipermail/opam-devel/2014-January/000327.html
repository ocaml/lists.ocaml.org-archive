I agree, as both debian packages and FreeBSD ports are aimed to have OS 
specific patches only in the tree. In a very special cases when upstream 
authors are unresponsive to critical bugs it is worth to enforce generic 
patches to be included, however, it seems that aspcud authors are rather 
active and it is worth to ask them first. Actually, my libc++ specific 
patch is from the same source: aspcud uses non-standard conventions of 
libstdc++ which is definitely not a good decision (for example, OS X 
uses clang as well).
