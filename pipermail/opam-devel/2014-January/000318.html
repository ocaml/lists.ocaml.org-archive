Thanks Louis for all this work!

As for the solver, unfortunately it is not a simple piece of code that can be
&quot;fixed&quot; with &quot;workarounds&quot;, that's why we have been strongly advocating to use a
modular architecture for package managers, with interchangeable solvers clearly
separated from the rest, see for example
<A HREF="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2012.09.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2012.09.002</A>

The only sensible thing to do is to actually package aspcud (and possibly
also packup and mccs) for Mac OSX and Windows, which is a reasonably simple
engineering task; I have contacted the developer team of aspcud to encourage
them to do this, and I do have hope to see this done in the year, but I have
no guarantee.

Considering the time frame, and the fact that this kind of issues is
going to come up more and more over time, I do understand that we need
a quicker solution, and the best thing is to ask for help with this 
among our friends OCamlrs...

I'll write a detailed mail on the list to this end this afternoon (now,
as alway, meeting... meeting... meeting :-( )
