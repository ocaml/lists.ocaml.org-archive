<PRE>I finally went the &quot;independent table that I manually (de)serialize
before and after download&quot; route. The current state of the script is
available at

and I'm looking for feedback on the preliminary results at

&gt;<i> Hi opam-devel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently hacking on a script to do a bulk update of OPAM
</I>&gt;<i> metadata, adding &quot;ocamlbuild&quot; as an explicit dependency of all
</I>&gt;<i> packages my killer heuristic decides certainly use ocamlbuild (right
</I>&gt;<i> now: there is a _tags or myocamlbuild.ml somewhere, but I'm soon going
</I>&gt;<i> to integrate the fact that an _oasis file explicitly lists ocamlbuild
</I>&gt;<i> as the relied-upon build system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is rather simple, with most of the time spent browsing through
</I>&gt;<i> the rich opam-library API.
</I>&gt;<i> - iterate over all packages in the repository (using the nice
</I>&gt;<i> Opam_admin_top.iter_packages function)
</I>&gt;<i> - for each package download the archive (I used
</I>&gt;<i> OpamAction.download_package for this, although it requires an
</I>&gt;<i> OpamState.t argument that I wasn't sure how to build&#185;)
</I>&gt;<i> - extract each archive (OpamFilename.extract_generic_file, under some
</I>&gt;<i> OpamFilename.with_tmp_dir call to get automatic cleanup)
</I>&gt;<i> - walk the archive to test ocamlbuild usage
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Caching downloaded archive works very well, so re-running the script
</I>&gt;<i> (during my test-refine feedback loops) does not re-download those as
</I>&gt;<i> well. Unfortunately, for a handful of packages, download fails, and it
</I>&gt;<i> only fails after a rather long timeout has expired, so just
</I>&gt;<i> re-iterating on those failed packages make a process that should be
</I>&gt;<i> instantaneous takes several minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here is my question: how can I test whether a package archive is
</I>&gt;<i> already in the cache? Because I know now that all packages that won't
</I>&gt;<i> time out have been cached by previous runs of my script, I could
</I>&gt;<i> iterate only on those. But I didn't find a clear way to do that (this
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be available internally in some OpamHTTP backend, but I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't seen this exported).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A way to cache not only the successfully downloaded archives, but also
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;did not work&quot; last time decision would also fit the bill. In the
</I>&gt;<i> worst case I could store that information in an independent table that
</I>&gt;<i> I would (de)serialize across invocations of my script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Opam seems to have fancy download functions designed to download a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of stuff in parallel, but that seems incompatible with the
</I>&gt;<i> sequential workflow imposed by `iter_packages`. I could first iterate
</I>&gt;<i> to build a list of URLs, then download everything in parallel, then
</I>&gt;<i> re-iterate but then again I need to only access the archives whose
</I>&gt;<i> download actually succeeded.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While we're at it: is there a simple way to get a pretty string from a
</I>&gt;<i> Package.t value? I use
</I>&gt;<i>           Printf.sprintf &quot;%s.%s&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             (OpamPackage.name_to_string package)
</I>&gt;<i>             (OpamPackage.version_to_string package)
</I>&gt;<i> but would expect this to be available already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The complete code of the current prototype script (it is not editing
</I>&gt;<i> any metada so far, just printing out the results that seem reasonable,
</I>&gt;<i> except that the _oasis part of the heuristic needs to be implemented
</I>&gt;<i> to get realistic results) is available at
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://github.com/gasche/opam/blob/2badfa0810e25ded1495b28b2ec8ff53f03a90cc/admin-scripts/add_ocamlbuild_dependency.ml">https://github.com/gasche/opam/blob/2badfa0810e25ded1495b28b2ec8ff53f03a90cc/admin-scripts/add_ocamlbuild_dependency.ml</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comment or advice is warmly welcome. In particular there is a
</I>&gt;<i> question in a comment about: what is the right way to build a
</I>&gt;<i> OpamState.t value?
