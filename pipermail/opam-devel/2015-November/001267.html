<PRE>Thanks for this Gabriel! Quick notes:

- I would really like opam-fmt to be lossless, so preserving comments
  seems like an extension that we should implement.  Ideally everyone
  can just call it on their packages without thinking about it.

- Having a bot regularly go through and reformat the entire repository
  also seems quite legit.  The alternative would be to reformat at the
  merge point, but this would require a staging branch.

- Any chance you could use cmdliner instead of Arg?  Fairly minor, but
  all the other plugins use it and it's nice to have the same behaviours
  for OPAM plugins where possible.

- How does this behave on pre-1.2 files?  I think it's about time that
  we deprecate pre-1.2 so that we can have clean metadata standards
  about the new fields such as dev-repo.

regards,
Anil

</I>&gt;<i> it became apparent that performing bulk updates on opam-repository is
</I>&gt;<i> made harder by the fact that the parse-print roundtrip does not
</I>&gt;<i> preserve human-formatted opam files. For my proposed patch I tried to
</I>&gt;<i> separate the reformatting of opam file (to follow the opam-lib printer
</I>&gt;<i> convention) from the actual changes in two separate commits, but that
</I>&gt;<i> means more work for script authors, and also creates patches that are
</I>&gt;<i> harder to review. (If (re)formatting was controlled by the maintainer
</I>&gt;<i> of the OPAM packages instead of authors of bulk updates, we would be
</I>&gt;<i> more confident in its correctness.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to move that discussion forward (how to maintain opam
</I>&gt;<i> metadata in a way that is easy for both human and scripts to work
</I>&gt;<i> with?), I propose the opam-fmt script that can be found at
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="https://github.com/gasche/opam-fmt/">https://github.com/gasche/opam-fmt/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote it in the last few days and there are probably some rough
</I>&gt;<i> edges. Once I feel that it should work, I may try to package it on the
</I>&gt;<i> opam-repo (in the meantime, clone then pin).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This suggests one possible way forward: publicize opam-fmt, encourage
</I>&gt;<i> users to reformat their opam files using it, adapt the opam-repository
</I>&gt;<i> QA to call `opam fmt --check` on opam files proposed in PR to enforce
</I>&gt;<i> it, and after some time (once we trust it works as expected thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> the human guinea pigs) reformat all older opam files to get a perfect
</I>&gt;<i> round-trip on all files of the repository.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not clear to me that this is the best way forward. (For example
</I>&gt;<i> it means that, in the current state of the opam file parsing/printing
</I>&gt;<i> code, comments in opam files would always be erased by reformatting.
</I>&gt;<i> Should we remove comments from the valid syntax of opam files, or
</I>&gt;<i> attach them to configuration lines to re-print them correctly later,
</I>&gt;<i> or maybe refuse to work on files with comments?) Opam developers and
</I>&gt;<i> repository maintainers may decide that the cost of caring about
</I>&gt;<i> reformatting outweigh the benefits in terms of scriptability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
