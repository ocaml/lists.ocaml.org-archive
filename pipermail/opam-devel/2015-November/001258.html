<PRE>Thank you (and Thomas, also!). It looks like --verbose/-vv is the main thing I missed - but I like the idea in <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2133">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2133</A> - if I'm seeing it a lot, I may pick it up and do it :o)


&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: opam-devel [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">opam-devel-bounces at lists.ocaml.org</A>] On Behalf Of
</I>&gt;<i> Louis Gesbert
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: 04 November 2015 01:47
</I>&gt;<i> To: <A HREF="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opam-devel">opam-devel at lists.ocaml.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [opam-devel] A few questions debugging packages &amp; opam
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some quick fire answers to these few questions from an opam expert or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two would be very much appreciated, please :o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, thanks a lot for your efforts!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Are there any circumstances in which opam (re)install -b deletes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the build directory?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm fairly sure that while doing an opam reinstall which crashed (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opam suffered an exception) during the install bit that the handler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deleted the build directory, despite -b being specified.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If opam really did delete the build directory in this instance, is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that a bug? (in which case I'll add it to my ToDo list)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> `--keep-build-dir` disables the removal of the build dir that normally
</I>&gt;<i> takes place _after_ a build only. Currently, every new build will still
</I>&gt;<i> start from a fresh dir, wiping any old one. This doesn't seem to be your
</I>&gt;<i> case though, so, probably a bug -- I would say an exception handler that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't properly check keep_build. I'll have a look.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. What's the correct set of flags to keep and obtain as much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information as possible for debugging package building?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -b gives me the build directory. Is the only way to get the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .{env,info,out,err} files kept to specify --debug?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, yes -- granted, that's a bit weird. Feel free to suggest
</I>&gt;<i> improvements on that, I debug opam itself a lot but am much less
</I>&gt;<i> confronted with debugging packages, so the tools there might be a bit
</I>&gt;<i> lacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Is there a tool or better way to view the output of each command
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the aforementioned files) than going through the .info files to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the right one and then looking at the appropriate other file?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are several ways, none of which may be perfect yet:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * `--verbose` will display each command and its output (as it is run if
</I>&gt;<i> there is only one running, when it finished when running in parallel). `--
</I>&gt;<i> debug` is more focused on debugging opam's internals, but also triggers
</I>&gt;<i> keeping of log files, which is weird.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * in recent builds, the `--json` option will output a json file that
</I>&gt;<i> includes the output of all failed commands. You may try the experimental
</I>&gt;<i> script at [1] to make it into a browsable html page (sample output at
</I>&gt;<i> [2]). The json doesn't, at the moment, include the output of commands that
</I>&gt;<i> didn't fail, though, so when a sequence failed you will only get the last
</I>&gt;<i> command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * see also the proposal at [3]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would it be appreciated if opam were patched to give the files a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canonical order (i.e. so that ls displays the log files in the order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they were executed)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That definitely sounds like an improvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. When changing opam source files which are part of the .cmxa/.cma
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries (e.g. opam-core, opam-format), I'm frequently forced to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make clean; make all as otherwise I get &quot;inconsistent assumption&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; errors over .cmx implementation (I'm building with 4.02.2).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that affecting anyone else, or is there something weird going on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the Windows Makefile dependencies that I should look into?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OCamlMakefile build is the one maintained officially, but it is for
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility and bootstrap, and it's awful at usage. I always build using
</I>&gt;<i> `make fast` when developing, which relies on ocp-build. It's better for my
</I>&gt;<i> nerves ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps, and thanks for the feedback!
