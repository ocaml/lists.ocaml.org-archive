&gt;<i> Florent, Anil, thanks for raising this issue, which is indeed
</I>&gt;<i> quite an interesting one, and requires some thought.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tracking license information is an important issue in general, but the case of
</I>&gt;<i> opam is quite special: opam &quot;packages&quot; just provide informations on building
</I>&gt;<i> binaries from sources that will be downloaded from somewhere on the net,
</I>&gt;<i> like BSD ports; they are not the same as typical binary packages
</I>&gt;<i> found on common GNU/Linux distros which need a very strict
</I>&gt;<i> licence screening process to accept packages (like Debian does);
</I>&gt;<i> as such, providing an opam package for a completely non-free
</I>&gt;<i> source is *not* a problem for opam: the possible licence
</I>&gt;<i> violation is perpetrated by the person that decides to build
</I>&gt;<i> the package on its own machine, not by the packager providing
</I>&gt;<i> the instructions on how to build it!
</I>&gt;<i> And it may be very well the case that such building instructions
</I>&gt;<i> are quite useful for people who have the right to use that software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To sum up:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I do not think that one is *obliged* remove the opam package for 
</I>&gt;<i>   passwdgen from opam-repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It is clear that one cannot make a copy of the *source code* of passwdgen
</I>&gt;<i>   on ocamlpro, so the opam package for passwdgen should point to the original
</I>&gt;<i>   URL for downloading the sources, not to an OCamlPro copy (which must be
</I>&gt;<i>   removed)
</I>
Note that these two go together: right now in OPAM we construct the
archive unconditionally, hence the immediate need for removal in the case
of unknown-licensed packages.

We can of course improve this, but it's good to fix licensing violations
as soon as we become aware of them.

&gt;<i> At the same time, making it easy for developers to incorportate non-free
</I>&gt;<i> code in their projects *without knowing it* is an issue, and I believe it
</I>&gt;<i> must be taken seriously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - extend the metadata for opam packages with a &quot;licenses&quot; key, holding
</I>&gt;<i>   a list of the licenses used in the source code (that may include
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;unknown&quot;); for this, we need a standardised list of values, and the
</I>&gt;<i>   SPDX standardised list available here <A HREF="https://spdx.org/licenses/">https://spdx.org/licenses/</A> is
</I>&gt;<i>   a good starting point (incomplete, though, as they do not list our
</I>&gt;<i>   favorite LGPL with OCaml exception :-))
</I>
OASIS has a nice library to handle all this doesn't it?  CCing Sylvain to
see if it can be separately used by OPAM.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - provide a simple guide for packagers pointing to the list of
</I>&gt;<i>   standard licence identifiers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - add an option to opam to print licence information on the packages;
</I>&gt;<i>   opam list -l might produce something like (the licences are fake here)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    aacplus                       --  LGPL-3.0+,LGPL-2.0 Bindings for the aacplus library which provides functions for decoding AAC audio files
</I>&gt;<i>    aifad                         --  LGPL-2.0+          Machine learning library and application written in OCaml which generalizes decision tree learning to algebraic data types
</I>&gt;<i>    alberto                       --  LGPL-2.0           OCaml interface to Erlang ports
</I>&gt;<i>    ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - later on, add &quot;profiles&quot; to opam that allow to specify that one refuses
</I>&gt;<i>   to install components with licences not included in a specific list
</I>&gt;<i>   that represents the &quot;house policy&quot;; actually, this would have a quite
</I>&gt;<i>   high added value for commercial developers
</I>
Indeed. For example, GPLv3 is banned in many commercial development situations,
so adding a house filter is a useful thing to have.
