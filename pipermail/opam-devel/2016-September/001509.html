So precisely: it will decode a lot of things the string production of RFC 7159 would not decode (it's not only about UTF-8 validity, you are not supposed to have control characters in encoded json text). I'm not demonstrating an attack but I precisely think that security is one of these topics were you don't want to &quot;do it like this until proven otherwise&quot;. If you like it that way so be it, but stop accusing me of FUD. When you implement a standard that refers to others final correctness is assumed given the other standards being implemented correctly, weakest link bla bla.

&gt;<i> The attack you are partially describing would be the ACME CA sending

</I>
I'm not describing an attack I'm describing an attack *vector* in any program that uses yojson. It may or may not be exploitable, but I absolutely dont care about this: you have the choice of not having this attack vector at all. Given the current trend of security breaches I expect good and responsible programmers to actually make the right choices. 

&gt;<i> You are sending messages containing unsubstantiated security claims
</I>See above. I'm not sending messages about security claims (I'm absolutely not a security expert and not interested beyond what is needed for me to write dependable software users can trust). I'm sending messages about a security mindset; don't use unsecure libraries that can open attack vectors in your programs.

&gt;<i> I find it quite something that your original messages were vague to the point of useless but now you
</I>&gt;<i> have expended far more effort justifying your opinion than would have been required to help the project.
</I>
Well I expected you to be a little more subtle than that and to understand the points without having to go that far in this discussion.
