This isn't quite the same as having opam-as-an-opam package.  If you manually
install clashing OPAM versions, you probably have a stable PATH pointing to
just one copy, and it won't change.

We cannot make the same guarantee of `opam config env` being executed due to
the vagaries of interactive-vs-non-interactive shells.  I'm pretty sure that
our behaviour for some shells such as Fish or Ksh is currently incorrect, but
I've not had a chance to test them personally.

One defensive feature to add in this case is to stamp the required OPAM client
version in ~/.opam and refuse to run if it's too low.  Thomas, Louis, this
check is only per-remote at the moment and not enforced globally within the
OPAM state is it?
