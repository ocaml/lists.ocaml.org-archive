My point (perhaps not made clearly enough) is that we already followed your
practice with OPAM 1.0 -&gt; 1.1.  The `repo` file performs the redirection to
the new repository (from <A HREF="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">http://opam.ocamlpro.com</A> containing the OPAM 1.0
format repository, to the new one at <A HREF="https://opam.ocaml.org">https://opam.ocaml.org</A> containing the
1.1 format).  Since only OPAM 1.1 looked for the `repo` file, older clients
would continue to work fine, albeit with outdated packages.

Was there some specific change you were proposing for future upgrades of
OPAM?  It's important to know those now, since some of the logic has to be
baked into the current 1.1 client in a point release.
