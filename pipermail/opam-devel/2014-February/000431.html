Well, it is one of the thing I don't like about github:

<A HREF="https://github.com/pdhborges/ocaml-zmq">https://github.com/pdhborges/ocaml-zmq</A>

And everything seems to be forked from this repository... So it looks
to me that the official repository is this one and that the owner is
pdhborges! You can argue that you can look at the network graph to see
that another one is more active and in advance, but this network graph
is super long to load and when it works, it is not that obvious who is
in advance....

But maybe I am missing the point here.

I don't like having my name in the URL for my project, because I don't
feel I have a strong ownership of it (or at least I would like to
invite anyone to participate).

&gt;<i> Like Anil, I'm not exactly sure how forge helps in this case as Active

</I>&gt;<i> users to understand where to find most resent sources. Opam should be able

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was suggesting the forge just for hosting tarballs, no dev involved there.

And indeed, OPAM can point to the official repository. But whenever
someone will look for ocaml-zmq on Google the first link will be
pdhborges/ocaml-zmq for at least a couple of months and most people
may assume that it is the official one. If you update this in OPAM,
you will have to go to OPAM read the page and realize that the
official one is not the one that Google reports.... I just think this
is misleading. But this is just about communication, no dev here.

But all this is a side discussion -- sorry to bring it here. I think
removal of ocaml-zmq and adding zmq with and updated URL is the way to
go for OPAM. This is a fine solution, probably better than hosting on
the Forge.
