<PRE>The Nix community is going through a similar discussion about package
ownership.  One suggestion is simply to delete all packages that do not
have an owner.  It's somewhat extreme but does guarantee packages at
least have a contact point that should keep the package up-to-date.

&gt;<i> I broadly agree with Anil's point about priorities.  opam-in-opam

</I>&gt;<i> way more important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of improving package quality, I wonder if we need better
</I>&gt;<i> tools to highlight to package owners when their packages fail.  One
</I>&gt;<i> approach would be for each package to have a set of owners, and for
</I>&gt;<i> each owner to have a status page that alerts them to problems with
</I>&gt;<i> their packages.  I think there would be a lot of value in alerting
</I>&gt;<i> people when their packages are broken, and it would be even better to
</I>&gt;<i> reject their pull requests automatically if it appears that they're
</I>&gt;<i> breaking the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A useful concept here is blame.  When something is broken, it's nice

</I>&gt;<i> wrong, and can be the responsible person to ensure it gets fixed, or
</I>&gt;<i> gets assigned to the right person to fix it.  I wonder if ocamlot (or

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Anil, I am worried that your workflow is not the typical workflow of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OCaml developers. You are an expert in OPAM, having several OPAM
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> repositories and so on. The typical user I imagine has little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge of OPAM, and expect upgrades of both the repository and of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OPAM to be as simple as possible. I remember using Cabal to install
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some Haskell software: I would do it once per year, at most, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everytime, I was very annoyed to discover some incompatibility that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would require an update of Cabal itself. Now, I fear to see the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem with OPAM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Fabrice,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do agree with you here of course.  I'm just noting from my experience
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with running quite a few OPAM-based tutorials in the last year (starting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the public beta release in ICFP 2012 with Thomas and Yaron, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequently from helping a number of non-OCaml users get started with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mirage and Real World OCaml, both of which require OPAM), that users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are primarily confused by two things:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Getting started with OPAM: including utop, their ocamlinit, and all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the other bits and bobs (especially editor integration).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Broken packages.  Part of the reason for Cabal's irritation are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorrect package constraints. Now, if you were leave an OPAM install
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a few months and upgrade, then you are using a very untested path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the solver.  A lot of things have to work *perfectly* to have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> successful package upgrade: the solver has to find a solution, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uninstall targets have to be correct (or else ocamlfind complains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the subsequent installation, and the installation must work including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depexts).  If anything goes wrong here, then the user's left to debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mess themselves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I prioritise improving these above anything else to do with OPAM for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my own hacking time.  We've made very significant progress (thanks to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Roberto and the aspcud team) in OPAM 1.1.1, but there is always more to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the second point, I must admit I'm a little disappointed by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lack of feedback to my various posts about doing OPAM bulk builds to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve the package repository quality.  After the Docker post [1]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which works on any modern Linux), I also published the logfiles from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the build [2] and triaged a number of bugs [3], but not many other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people have contributed fixes.  I would very much like to get to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100% package installation rate, which we can then keep at 100% due to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ongoing package testing for new pull requests.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The question of upgrading OPAM itself has never come up with anyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since most users simply used their OS-installed tool to upgrade from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OPAM 1.0 to 1.1.  The only major bug with this approach was because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the release of OCaml 4.01 coincided with OPAM 1.1, and a lot of Mac
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users ended up upgrading their system compiler *and* OPAM simultaneously,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which led to complete meltdown of their ~/.opam (see [4])
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [4] <A HREF="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/24315">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/24315</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This nasty bug should tell us that upgrades are just very complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and need a lot of testing (we tested system compiler updates, and OPAM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version updates, but never together!). I would expect any auto-update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> procedure to  at least consider these issues:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - What happens during an upgrade if a newly installed OPAM binary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   inside a ~/.opam requires an upgrade of the OPAM metadata?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - If you do an opam update using the OPAM binary installed within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the ~/.opam space, how do you avoid a 'text file busy' error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   due to being unable to replace the currently executing binary?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   We see this a lot on Mirage [5] due to the command line tool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   and the libraries being mixed up, as mentioned earlier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - If the user invokes OPAM without first calling `opam config env`,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   they will use the *old* OPAM with a *new* repository.  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   is currently a non-issue since there is only one OPAM binary,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   and all sub-commands spawned by it apply the correct env variables.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The autoupdate scheme proposed will absolutely require that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   user has correctly set up their `opam config env`, which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   something that I've observed many users not do (including myself).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   This will thus require support and testing of downgrade.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [5] <A HREF="https://travis-ci.org/mirage/mirage-www/jobs/17859382">https://travis-ci.org/mirage/mirage-www/jobs/17859382</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Even if it's not easy to achieve, because of the risk of breaking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other OPAM features, I think &quot;transparent update&quot; is definitively
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something the typical user of OPAM would like and find very cool with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OPAM, and worth adding the feature to the roadmap !
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm obviously not against adding magical auto-updating, but I hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that any such proposal will consider the issues i raise above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I'm going to spend my limited time working on what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've observed are the real (but admittedly more boring) problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with day-to-day OPAM use that I listed above, such as upstream
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packaging and improving the repository quality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More broadly, I do not believe that we should get too dependent on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OPAM and ignore upstream binary packaging. In Xen for example,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Debian and Fedora packages require binary OCaml packages to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> link against, and telling everyone to use OPAM is not an acceptable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer.
