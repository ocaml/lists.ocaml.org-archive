&gt;<i> That's awesome, thanks ! I am in the process of reviewing the patch ; in its current state it will work for basic packages but won't handle patches, .install files and such more advanced features. I am wondering also if this should fit in opam itself, or in an external tool like opam admin / opamfu, as this is mostly independent from the current opam installation (except for repositories used). Making it external would ensure there is no issue with the current state being loaded and used for filtering the commands.

It was first part of opam-admin (as one can probably see from resolve_deps code :) ) but then it was not very convenient to use. It handles patches just fine, because
it archives the build directory after patches are applied (that's on purpose). I am not sure whether using the current state is good or bad actually, because
it ensures that the state bundled is the state used during development (that is - tested). On the other hand it doesn't fit well with {:installed} flags and optional
dependencies..

&gt;<i> When my compilers-as-packages branch lands, hopefully this won't require any more work for bundling :)
</I>
Nice!

&gt;<i> Integrating proper depexts and/or post-messages processing in a generated shell-script sounds very tedious, not sure what the best approach would be here but just outputing the info at bundle-generation time to help document may be good enough for a start.
</I>
Ack.
