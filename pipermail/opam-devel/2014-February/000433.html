</I>
Note that it's possible to just mail GitHub support to disconnect your
repo from the fork graph.  I've done this for several Mirage libraries
that had to be switched around.

As for ownership, we just set up an organization when such things are
required (again, see <A HREF="http://github.com/mirage">http://github.com/mirage</A> or many others for how
this works).

&gt;&gt;<i> Like Anil, I'm not exactly sure how forge helps in this case as Active

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users to understand where to find most resent sources. Opam should be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to provide a reference to the relevant fork on github.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was suggesting the forge just for hosting tarballs, no dev involved there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And indeed, OPAM can point to the official repository. But whenever

</I>
This is indeed a good point, which is why I raised the question of
transition here rather than just commit the change.  The opam.ocaml.org
web-ranking is improving though, so it should be reasonably obvious
that running an &quot;opam search zmq&quot; will be the latest version.  We
shouldn't leave two concurrent versions of the library in opam stable
for too long.
