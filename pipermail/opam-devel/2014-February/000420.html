<PRE>This is great! (CCing opam-devel)

I'd like to resolve the zmq situation, since the current &quot;ocaml-zmq&quot; package in opam-stable has no maintainer, and is pointing to an unstable tarball.

We could add a new zmq package to OPAM that does not clash with &quot;ocaml-zmq&quot; , based off the Issuu branch which appears maintained.  I'm CCing Anders Fugmann for his opinion on this.  After a while, we could remove the ocaml-zmq package if the upstream cannot be contacted.

That should hopefully unblock getting iocaml into OPAM mainline too...

</I>&gt;<i> IOCaml is an OCaml kernel for the IPython notebook (<A HREF="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">http://ipython.org/notebook.html</A>).  This provides a REPL within a web browser with a nice user interface including markdown based comments/documentation, mathjax formula and the possibility of generating all manner of HTML based output media from your code.  Here are a few features I think are particularly interesting;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Uses ocp-index.lib to provide code completion and types (includes documentation if .cmt files exist).  Only works with installed libraries at the moment.  Very new, a wee bit buggy, but I love it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * I copy/pasted the OCaml core language documentation page into a notebook.  Now you can learn interactively! [1]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Play with TyXML in the notebook and render typed HTML interactively.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Installation is reasonably painless through opam, though you currently need to add my remote repository [2] and require a &gt;=4.00.1 compiler.  Installation of IPython is a touch more involved as you will have to update (using 'pip') some python components [3].  Instructions for Ubuntu 13.10 are on the github page and I have also tested Fedora 20 which was, apart from some slightly different package names, very similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Andy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] I am not sure if, according to the license terms, I should be providing this.  The documentation has not been changed in any way apart from one inserted paragraph at the start explaining the difference between a normal toplevel and the notebook interface.  I hope it's OK to provide this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [2] I'd love to push this to opam proper but require ocaml-zmq &gt;=3.2.  There was a recent discussion on the list about this (indeed reading about ZeroMQ led me to IPython) so hopefully this will happen before too long.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [3] I haven't tested this release with 0.13.2 which the distros provide.  Maybe it works anyway.
