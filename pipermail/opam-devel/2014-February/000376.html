</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===&gt;           opam version n+1 is added also to repo version n
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===&gt; Sometimes later: the user of opam n runs an update, sees that a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===&gt;                 version of opam is available, and upgrades it...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                      he now has the new opam, that updates the references
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                      to the new repository, and keeps following the evolution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                      of the repository, with no pain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, basically, my big feature whish is to see opam *packaged* as an opam
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; package. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I remember that in the past that was the case, but there were issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that forced opam to stop being an opam package. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder what these issues were, and whether they can now easily be solved...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one is the location where the binary opam should be installed: as I said in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previous mail, it cannot go under the 4.00/3.12/whatever directories, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposed to be the package manager, maybe there are other?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> This is a very tricky interaction to get right, 
</I>
Really? I would like to know more about this; please add the factual elements
to #1150

&gt;<i> and the opportunity cost is that of focussing on better upstream integration of OPAM itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My view is that we should focus on getting the OPAM packages upstreamed more
</I>&gt;<i> widely, and (possibly) provide package manager hooks to trigger an OPAM update
</I>&gt;<i> along with an OS update.
</I>
Now, that's a tricky issue: with dozens of platforms to support, getting the
opam platform-specific package rolled out in a timely manner, and without
too much skew is definitely far from easy.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Getting the recursive dependency sorted for a rolling upgrade is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work, hard to test, 
</I>
Again, I'd like to see more precise arguments about this: I'm surely too
optimistic, but it might just be a matter of adding some specific metadata
for the opam package.

&gt;<i> and of questionable utility (since the original OPAM will be obtained via
</I>&gt;<i> the OS package manager, 
</I>
See above

&gt;<i> and the new one will disappear if the
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.opam is destroyed by the user, therefore downgrading their version of OPAM).
</I>
Sure, but if I shoot myself in the foot and destroy ~/.opam, that's my proble, right?
