</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One semi-interesting issue I've already discovered with depexts is that just a &quot;ubuntu&quot; tag isn't enough, since  some depexts are only valid in a specific version of Ubuntu.

</I>Two remarks:
1. Using the version numbers might be much less confusing than the codenames
2. I agree that we need to agree on useable syntax (and semantics) for
depexts. See <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/991">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/991</A>

&gt;<i> I personally dislike this depexts field to mention OS packages at all.
</I>Why ?
This seems to be the most sane and generic option if we wish to interact
with the system's package manager [0].

&gt;<i> Maybe it's better to specify which external libraries are needed (as .so or as pkg-config files) and then
</I>&gt;<i> use native OS way (at installation time) to determine which package contains that .so or .pc file (e.g. apt-file on Debian).
</I>Not all package managers provide these kind of facilities.
That is someting that, for instance, will not exist in any source-based
distribution that I am aware of.

Moreover, it seems unwise to fill in information that ought to belong in
the distribution's packages :
if I depend on libfoo, major version 1, any minor version, should
I specify &#8220;libfoo-1.so&#8221;, &#8220;libfoo-1(.\d+)*.so&#8221; (dots implicitly
escaped), or some crazier scheme ?
Where will I look for the .so ?
(And while using pkg-config is better, it still isn't supported by all
external dependencies)

&gt;<i> If apt-file is not present it is at least possible to tell (with dpkg -S or ldconfig -p) whether the .so is present and what is
</I>&gt;<i> precisely needed for the build to succeed (and mention how to find the needed package manually).
</I>Don't the conf-* packages already achieve this (in an hackish way) ?

&gt;<i> It may be even possible to gater information about .so files automatically - by inspecting generated cmxa and cma
</I>&gt;<i> files with ocamlobjinfo - so it can be done by ocamlot or something like that.
</I>How would you get them to build in the first place ?

other equivalents for OSX and/or Windows).
