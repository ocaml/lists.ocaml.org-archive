<PRE>Hello,

Is there a blessed way to install packages system-wide using Opam? I
suspect there isn't, so I attached a document [1] that describes my
use-cases and what I'm thinking of (of course I know you opam
developers are busy).

Thanks!

Best,

# Global installation with Opam

I have a few use cases in which I would like to use opam to install libraries
or programs written in OCaml (with non-trivial dependencies) on a GNU/Linux
system.

- I share a machine with several colleagues, and
  developed [a few tools](<A HREF="https://github.com/c-cube/frog-utils">https://github.com/c-cube/frog-utils</A>) to make it
  easy to parallelize jobs without stepping on one another's toes. I would
  like a &quot;global&quot; opam switch that would install the binaries and libraries
  in `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib` so that everyone can use the same
  version easily (and make upgrade easier).
- When developing a web application, CGI program, or other Unix daemon (a
  server, basically), it's better to use the system's init program to
  start/stop the daemon. It is possible (although, imho, ugly) to compile
  and install the daemon in `~/.opam/&lt;switch&gt;/bin` and use this path from the
  init script. However, the daemon should not fail if the user
  were to suddenly &quot;opam switch&quot; to an experimental compiler just at the
  wrong moment. A much cleaner solution is to install those kinds of binaries
  to `/usr/local/bin/` or something similar.
- for teaching, it would be nice to install (on a network filesystem?) the
  libraries and tools required for a course (especially if they eat up
  a lot of disk space quotas, or take time to compile. Example: Coq). The
  students could then all use the same libraries, already installed,
  in the same version as every other student. Headache--.

I'm not aware of a clean way to do it currently, so here's how I would like
things to work (please, Santa):

There would be a special switch (maybe `system`, I'm not sure how it works
currently), let's call it `global`. This switch assumes that OCaml **and**
ocamlfind are already installed by whatever package manager the distribution
provides. Everything installed with this switch would be installed in
`/usr/local/bin/` and `/usr/local/lib/` (and `/usr/local/share/doc/` etc.) so
that it can be used without opam. Other switches (`4.02.1`, `4.03-PR-123`, etc.)
would behave exactly the same as they do currently.

Security issues: to limit the potential impact of evil opam packages, here are
a few possibilities when compiling/installing with the `global` switch:

- compilation as a user, only installation as root (use `sudo`, or require
  root rights, and fork+drop privilege to run the &quot;build&quot; target)
- compilation within a chroot in `/tmp/` (no possibility for `make install`
  to erase stuff as a root,
  see [this fail](<A HREF="https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/commit/a047be85247755cdbe0acce6f1dafc8beb84f2ac">https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/commit/a047be85247755cdbe0acce6f1dafc8beb84f2ac</A>)),
  then copy files to their right location. Also allows to track what files a
  package has copied so that un-installation can get rid of them.
