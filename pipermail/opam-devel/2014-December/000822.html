<PRE>I just reproduced it by following the referenced bug report.

From a fresh Ubuntu 14.10, if I do:

$ sudo apt-get install opam camlp4-extra aspcud
$ opam init -a
$ opam install mirage -y
$ eval `opam config env`

At this point some packages have been installed and mirage is installed.

Now however, if I use mirage it invokes opam install again and packages
are reinstalled as a duplicate.  See below:

opam install --yes conduit cow cowabloga crunch cstruct io-page lwt mirage-clock-unix mirage-conduit mirage-console mirage-fs-unix mirage-http mirage-net-unix mirage-types mirage-unix tcpip vchan
[NOTE] Package mirage-types is already installed (current version is 2.1.0).
[NOTE] Package lwt is already installed (current version is 2.4.6).
[NOTE] Package io-page is already installed (current version is 1.1.1).
[NOTE] Package cstruct is already installed (current version is 1.4.0).
[NOTE] Package crunch is already installed (current version is 1.3.0).
[WARNING] mirage-unix.2.1.0 references unknown package mirage-profile
The following actions will be performed:
 - install ocamlfind.1.5.5 [required by cowabloga, crunch, mirage-fs-unix, mirage-http]

I've not managed to narrow it down further to a smaller test case, but the OPAMDEBUG
gist is up at: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/avsm/62e28b05e2b282ed5fbe">https://gist.github.com/avsm/62e28b05e2b282ed5fbe</A>

Any inspiration from there from the CUDF interactions in the above gist?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like the latest Ubuntu has a completely broken OPAM out of the box since it ships with OPAM 1.1.1 and Aspcud 1.9 (which requires OPAM 1.2 due to a changed solver interface).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This leads to issues such as this: <A HREF="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/issues/59">https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/issues/59</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does anyone know how to get in touch with Ubuntu folk to request a backport of OPAM 1.2 to Ubuntu 14.10?
