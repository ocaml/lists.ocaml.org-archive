Version filtering isn't what I meant, though - I meant semantic filtering, i.e. a relevant test case which fails for this &quot;broken&quot; version but works in the older versions (or corrected newer versions). IMO, version filtering is something packagers do with package meta-data; developers should use version filtering only because of API changes which isn't applicable here.

</I>
Again, in my opinion, &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot;. My own personal experience is that if something like this has happened it is *very* likely it will happen again (and that's in no way a negative comment on any developers concerned!)

There are plenty of other instances in configure scripts where semantics are tested rather than a version compatibility matrix (usually when probing the C compiler) so I don't think it's too unusual a thing to want to do?
