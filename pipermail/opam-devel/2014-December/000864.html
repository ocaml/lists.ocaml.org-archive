That's exactly what 'opam-manager' [1] provides ; also, still error-prone, but you can always set a switch in a given shell instance using `eval $(opam config env --switch &lt;switch&gt;)` as mentionned in the FAQ [2] ; I recenlty improved `opam switch` to be much more helpful when you are not in the standard situation.

I agree with Daniel that switches may not be the best solution -- but I am afraid that opening this door is a very bad idea until build and link tools more widely support it.

</I>
As I understand it at the moment, a switch is defined by a `.comp` file: this is basically just a set of &quot;base&quot; (e.g. immovable) packages that get installed at creation (we can now count the compiler as one of them). 
Then, as for the `opam switch` command, a switch is
- a prefix, and the associated set of environment variables
- a set of installed packages
- a set of pinned packages and their definitions

Now, we have built on this quite strong basis for a while with success, so I agree with Daniel that we must be very careful and specify precisely what will be going on before we start breaking the wall between switches -- or even moving more stuff inside them, as with per-switch remotes.
