<PRE>Dear all,
     just a few lines to let you know that an update of the CUDF and DOSE
libraries that lie at the heart of Opam is ongoing: cudf.0.7 is already in
the repository, and dose.3.2 is coming (preceded by some rc candidates).

These updates add new features to both libraries and fix quite a few open issues
with Dose.  While most of these are essentially relevant for Debian (multiarch
support and bootsrap calculations), the new release also integrate many of the
patches originally independently maintained inside Opam w.r.t. the old 3.1
branch, and solve several issues with preferences and external solvers found
over the last months.

Over the next days, these packages will be taken up and used by the first test
case in Travis, and despite the many and long tests performed on a separate Opam
branch, some issues may come up.

If you notice something strange that can be traced to the new versions of cudf
and/or dose, please let me know.

Have a nice week-end

-- 
Roberto
