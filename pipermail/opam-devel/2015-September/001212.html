</I>&gt;<i> Since the opam environment is also the user's shell environment, we

</I>
Agreed.  It's ok to substitute a PATH if it was inserted by OPAM, but
the environment should otherwise be unchanged.

Note that OPAM does scrub some variables during the invocation of a
subshell (MAKEFLAGS in particular) to prevent environment parallel
flags to propagate to packages, but nothing like this happens in the
PATH.

&gt;&gt;<i> Any ideas how we can have opam manage PKG_CONFIG_PATH so that build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts don't have to?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I've sent this to both the mirage &amp; opam lists - apologies if that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> causes too much noise, but I figure it affects both projects).
</I>
I think we could definitely use an answer to pkg-config management,
but not one that's entwined into the core of OPAM itself. If something
could be figured out that fits in with the compilers-as-packages
feature so that packages could extend the environment, this would
make cross-OS portability much easier.

In general, how important is pkg-config for library tracking?  Is 
our interest in it the consequence of some third-party packages
using it, or do we want it to be the defacto mechanism for handling
system link flags (a bit like ocamlfind for OCaml)?  If the latter,
then quite a bit of work needs to be done for straggling system
libraries that aren't packaged up using pkg-config, which I fear is
a neverending task.  I'm also curious to know how it works in a
Nix-like environment in terms of the composibility of PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
