In the meantime I upgraded from Wheezy to Jessie.
With Jessie's version of Aspcud (1.9.0-2) everything
works fine.  I think the problem may just have been
the *very* old version of Aspcud (2011.03.17.dfsg-6)
from Wheezy.


Anyway, I doubt it's worth to have OPAM support ancient
versions of Aspcud, particularly since Jessie's release
is just around the corner...

Best regards,
Dario Teixeira

That's pretty cool!  In the end I solved the problem
simply by upgrading from Wheezy to Jessie, but this
solver farm may indeed come in handy sometime...

Agreed, but we really ought to have configure checks to
spot such broken combinations though.

I've left the OPAM bulk builder rsyncing to a new logging volume on opam.ocaml.org (separate volume so if it gets full, it wont affect the rest of the infrastructure at all):

    http://opam.ocaml.org/builds/

The jobs are currently run on a 48-core machine on a looping cron, so I'm just going to manually keep an eye on it for a few runs to check it's all stable.  Once that's done I'll publish a blog post detailing how all the Docker scripts fit together.  Until then, triage failures away :-)

It would be nice to be able to filter the list by package maintainer. So that I can quickly see if there's something wrong with what I (am supposed) to maintain.

Absolutely, but that's v2 -- I'm porting the whole logging infrastructure to Irmin, so you can both clone the logs and use the web UI to browse.  But this one is still useful by itself, so I thought I'd upload it instead of blocking on the next version.

It should have `-y` in there, so I'm a bit stumped.
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-depext/blob/master/depext.ml#L166

I've swapped the next run to use `opam depext -d` to log the exact command being run...

That's useful, thanks! I've created:

Seems not to run anymore.  Would you restart it?  (Or is the volume

Yep, it's working fine. I published source and an x86_64 binary for
the rc in case anyone else wants to try it:

$ 0install update opam --not-before 1.2.2-rc1
$ opam --version
1.2.2

Will let you know if I find any problems. Very happy to have a working
"man" command again too ;-)

Hi;

I seem to be having a problem with the Jane Street TLS cert for
ocaml.janestreet.com. OPAM is refusing to install sexplib etc as a
result. I presume this is a curl TLS issue and I need a magic
environment variable or something, but can't find it. Any ideas?

This is on OSX using homebrew curl and OPAM 1.2.0.

This is a broken `curl` command on base OSX.  Try switching to wget with:

    export OPAMFETCH=wget

CCing Yaron Minsky and Jeremie Diminio about the Jane Street setup -- this is
likely a result of disabling SSLv3 due to the POODLE attack.

I don't think this is related to the problem you're seeing with curl as curl works fine on Debian Jessie.

Probably complains about lack of ECDHE, but then Firefox does use ECHDE, and Chrome doesn't:

Doesn't seem to be honoured by `opam upgrade`. Have filed an issue.

OPAMFETCH is from 1.2.1 ; which will also choose wget over curl on OSX to work around this specific issue. On 1.2.0, I'm afraid the only workaround is not to have curl in your PATH.

Thanks-- I realised that I was only on 1.2.0 due to using homebrew and
having installed HEAD version in the past, which (appears to have
meant) that it wasn't getting auto-updated with `brew update && brew
upgrade`. I forced the update to 1.2.1 with `brew reinstall opam` and
it's all fine now.
