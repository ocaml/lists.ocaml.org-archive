<PRE>Dear all,

I'm resurrecting this thread to get some information about the current
status of CUDF solver packaging on Fedora.

I am myself a happy user of the COPR ascpud packages, but for new
Fedora users it would be nice to have something packaged in the main
repository. Is that a possibility?

I would appreciate being CCed in on this (or better, opam-devel if cross posting is ok), as I maintain the semi-official OPAM Fedora packages right now that point people to the OBS service.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the interests of sanity, I'd rather not have two divergent sets of instructions for Coq users and the general OPAM population, so if we switch to Copr, then the official OPAM instructions should also switch.  In the longer term, the packages will get into Fedora and everything will be fine, but don't forget that in the medium term that the Yum remotes will remain on people's computers for some time, and there's significant confusion in mixing up OBS and Copr packages.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For Coq users right now, I think it's wiser to point them to the OPAM web pages which in turn point to my OBS repositories, rather than pointing them to Jon's.  The reason is that mine are better tested, but they also use the bundled OCaml packages, whereas Jon's are upstream-friendly and break out the OPAM dependencies.  There have been bugs from doing this in the past (e.g. with a libdose3 mismatch), so it's best to let this settle down upstream before pointing a large user base at a Copr remote that may still be a moving target.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Totally agreed. There's probably still be an argument for pointing out the aspcud copr remote though - should that go onto the main opam page?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good -- although can we perhaps abstract it to an 'ocaml' account and share the details?  Since the repo names stick around, it's quite stifling to have your personal branch be used by people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally having aspcud is very very nice.  I'll try to get it on OBS soon as well from your RPMs.
