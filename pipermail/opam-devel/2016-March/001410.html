<PRE>Removing `--insecure`: absolutely, I would be glad to if I get agreement from 
the repository team.

Sandboxing: we've actually been studying this recently with Gr&#233;goire, and it 
seems it's not that difficult to do on Linux, using the namespaces. The related 
features are actually available with just some calls to `unshare` and `mount`, 
and we wrote a quick script that makes ~ read-only, while keeping only the 
build dir read-write, and disabling network. That's for build, for install, 
only the switch prefix should be rw, and the build dir ro. It's absolutely not 
secure for now, but it's a good start.

With that, my idea for 2.0 was to provide a generic way to configure wrappers 
for package commands in the different scopes, document how to put the namespace 
control in place, and do it on our automated tests on Linux: this would allow 
to test the feature well, and provide a good sanity check, if nothing more 
except for opt-in users. This would also allow to try implementations on other 
OSes (I am sure the Docker guys would be glad to help, this is their stuff 
after all ? ;)). If successful, the next release could include it built-in.

How does this sound ?

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> what I miss from this mail is sandboxing - while &quot;tracking installed
</I>&gt;<i> files&quot; is included - but what about containing the build process in a
</I>&gt;<i> chroot-like environment (there was somewhere a long discussion what is
</I>&gt;<i> suitable and what not on which platforms).  Is anyone putting effort
</I>&gt;<i> into this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since signing won't make it into 1.3 (or 2.0, however you name it), I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to propose to remove the &quot;--insecure&quot; and &quot;--no-check-certificate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> arguments from the download program [curl/wget] (in
</I>&gt;<i> src/repository/opamDownload.ml).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The history of this starts in <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/55">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/55</A> -
</I>&gt;<i> some sites had invalid/untrusted certificates.  A followup is in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2006">https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2006</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My reasoning: certificates which are trusted with the OS shipped trust
</I>&gt;<i> anchors are nowadays easy to get (let's encrypt hands those out for
</I>&gt;<i> free, startssl and others also provide free certificates).  In order to
</I>&gt;<i> improve this Internet, it is better to be picky (so that people will
</I>&gt;<i> actually fix their https infrastructure).  Also given that some work has
</I>&gt;<i> been done to transparently mirror packages, there'll be a (secure!?)
</I>&gt;<i> fallback in case package authors mess sth up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People who don't bother can still manually setup their download tool to
</I>&gt;<i> sth which does not check any certificates.  Secure should be the default
</I>&gt;<i> (also for downloading the opam repository, which is done via https, but
</I>&gt;<i> no certificates are checked).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure someone (either opam weather status or dockerized scripts, or
</I>&gt;<i> the mirror) will be easily able to setup infrastructure to report
</I>&gt;<i> archive download failures immediately and report them upstream.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for working on this, Louis (and others), and I'm looking forward
</I>&gt;<i> to a new release really soon now,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> hannes
