it's useful to figure out the workflow for people such that it'll actually get adoption...

not necessarily; the keybase model seems to support a pure JS workflow where the private keys are never &quot;on the cloud&quot; but on the local machine.  In practise, having a mode that lets people do a single-click-or-two sign will make the difference between having to whip out out a CLI (much like the &quot;merge&quot; button in GitHub greatly accelerates the common case of pull request handling).

A CLI utility to sign is fine, but submitting it via yet another communication mechanism seems unnecessary.
