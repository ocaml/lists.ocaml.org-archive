You are right.  The equivalent of Ivar.fill is Lwt.wakeup (not wait,
my mistake) and it runs all thunk functions immediately.  However I
believe that people don't often rely on this behavior and changing it
to be the same as async wouldn't be a problem.  In fact there is
already a Lwt.wakeup_later function in lwt since Lwt.wakeup can be
problematic. It used to cause a stack overflow in Lwt_mutex for
instance.  That would require an addition to the signature of the Lwt
module to still be able to use it in an environment without a
scheduler (basically running all pending jobs).

&gt;<i> I think it's worth noting the [Monitor] construct of Async here,

</I>
Indeed.  In lwt such exceptions are captured inside the lwt monad.
