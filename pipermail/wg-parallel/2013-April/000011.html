</I>Yes. it was about disk IO, on Linux.

(from the top of my head, we did something like this:

     Lwt_unix.execute_job
-            (pread_job (Lwt_unix.unix_file_descr ch) len offset)
-            (fun job -&gt; pread_result job buf pos)
-            pread_free


which was dead slow.


At that point in time, we also experimented with Lwt_unix.Async_switch
but that gave SEGVs

Some more remarks:
we have seen scheduling differences between different Lwt versions,
In the past, the scheduling was eager, while the current one is very 
round-robin-ish,
and performance impact for us is about -10%. (we have no problem with 
that, it's just an observation)

Posix is indeed broken for all things related to file IO.
* not all file descriptors are equal:
[select on a file descriptor for a regular file, always returns true, 
while for a socket you get more relevant results]
* things can have empty implementations (fe I believe the fsync 
implementation on OSX is something like this:
    int fsync(int fd) {return 0;}

    )

* for a lot of behaviour,
   you depend on file system choices and sys-admin choices (mount options)
   and they have a talent for the wrong choices.


In essence: the situation is a mess.

have fun,

Romain.
