Got it. I don't have a feel for the performance impact of such deferred
scheduling, except that the difference between busy-spinning if there are
outstanding requests, vs dropping into select/kqueue/epoll more frequently
is very significant.

For example, the Arakoon folks anecdotally reported a 20x performance loss
between a direct Unix implementation of their database layer vs an Lwt
one.  A loss that large can only be explained by context switching or
pathological scheduling somewhere (given we know that Lwt doesn't result
in a lot more allocation on the major heap).
<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/eikke/arakoon">http://www.slideshare.net/eikke/arakoon</A> (slide 14/15)
(I'm CCing Romain, who might have details).

Either way, this seems like a good time to establish a few simple
microbenchmarks such as a TCP iperf or HTTPbench, just to have a few
baseline numbers to evaluate such design decisions against.  I do believe
that the Async 'drop to scheduler' behaviour is far easier to understand
than Lwt's, but not if it costs an order of magnitude in I/O throughput.
