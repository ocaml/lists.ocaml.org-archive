I believe Anil is interested in moving Mirage to Async (Anil, can you
confirm?), and Jeremie and Stephen are going to do the reorganization
of Core so that there is a Core_kernel that's more portable than the
full Core, and Async's core (which we're going to rename to
Async_kernel) is going to depend only on Core_kernel.

As Jeremie said, the Lwt shim seems doable, and we'll look into that
as an intern project this summer.

I should say: I very much endorse Daniel's suggestion that codecs
should when possible be written in such a way as to be adaptible
between multiple engines.

As a side note, it looks like we're not the only community with this
problem.  There are some interesting discussions in the Scala
community about the mismatch between Akka futures and Finagle
futures.  It's all very reminisicent.

We're also contemplating having an intern look as to whether Libuv
would be a reasonable way of getting Async to be more portable to
other places, including Windows.
