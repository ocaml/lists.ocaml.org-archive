I have briefly looked at OCaml last year, and had the crazy idea that the bindings should be auto-generated from these XML specs:
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gl-xml-specs/src">https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gl-xml-specs/src</A>

Those are quite up-to-date (OpenGL 4.3), and they are themselves generated by importing/parsing some files from opengl.org's registry
and fixing bugs in them.

The problem is that even if glcaml/glMLite was updated to use those XML specs as a source, it wouldn't be very useful without
a comprehensive unit test, or at the very least one test/function so that it was generated correctly (i.e. it doesn't crash).

And then there's the problem that it is quite easy to misuse these APIs, as they are after all C APIs. glMLite might be a bit safer here,
but I think you can still cause use-after-free bugs.

So my other crazy idea was that perhaps some higher-level bindings should be auto-generated that would call into the low-level bindings safely,
after all those XML specs do have *some* type information (and various objects could be wrapped in a record that tracks
whether they are freed or not and raises exception if they are).

This looked like quite a huge amount of work to do alone, so it all remained at the idea stage.
Maybe some day, when I have lots of time... :)

Best regards,
