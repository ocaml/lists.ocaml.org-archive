Subject: [ocaml-opengl] [ANN] Tgls 0.8.0
Message-ID: <4A9FB678604E4F2A83757044FD0E7317@erratique.ch>

Hello,   

I?d like to announce the first release of Tgls:

  Tgls is a set of independent OCaml libraries providing thin bindings
  to OpenGL libraries. It has support for core OpenGL 3.{2,3} and
  4.{0,1,2,3,4} and OpenGL ES {2,3}.

  Tgls depends on ocaml-ctypes and the C OpenGL library of your
  platform. It is distributed under the BSD3 license.

Home page: http://erratique.ch/software/tgls   
API Documentation: http://erratique.ch/software/tgls/doc

Information about OpenGL version coverage:  
https://github.com/dbuenzli/tgls#supported-opengl-versions

It should soon be available in opam.

Best,

Daniel

P.S. Some background information about the library can be found in this message:

Hello,  

I?d like to announce the first release of Tsdl:

  Tsdl is an OCaml library providing thin bindings to the cross-platform
  SDL C library.

  Tsdl depends on the SDL 2.0.1 C library (or later) and ocaml-ctypes. Tsdl
  is distributed under the BSD3 license.



Home page: http://erratique.ch/software/tsdl
API documentation: http://erratique.ch/software/tsdl/doc/Tsdl

It should be available in opam shortly.

Part of this work was made undercover while I was visiting OCaml Labs last
summer, many thanks to them for their support.  

Best,

Daniel

P.S. On macosx we still have some kind of unresolved spinning bug [1] that seem to be due to an interaction
with libffi. It can be circumvented by using a compiler switch with this patch [2] (basically remove the  
-no_compact_unwind option and add -w to silence the huge pile of warnings that ensue).
